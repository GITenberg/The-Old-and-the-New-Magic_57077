<h2 class="h2herein">SKETCH OF HENRY RIDGELY EVANS.</h2>

<p class="pfirst">“Henry Ridgely Evans,
journalist, author and librarian, was
born in Baltimore, Md., November 7, 1861. He is the son of
Henry Cotheal and Mary (Garrettson) Evans. Through his
mother he is descended from the old colonial families of Ridgely,
Dorsey, Worthington and Greenberry, which played such a
prominent part in the annals of early Maryland. Mr. Evans
was educated at the preparatory department of Georgetown
(D. C.) College and at Columbian College, Washington, D. C.
He studied law at the University of Maryland, and began its
practice in Baltimore City; but abandoned the legal profession
for the more congenial avocation of journalism. He served
for a number of years as special reporter and dramatic critic on
the ‘Baltimore News,’ and subsequently became connected with
the U. S. Bureau of Education, as one of the assistant librarians.
In 1891 he was married to Florence, daughter of Alexander
Kirkpatrick, of Philadelphia.”—National Cyclopedia of American
Biography.</p>

<p id="pp-iii">Mr. Evans is an ardent student of folk-lore, masonic antiquities, psychical
research, and occultism. Many of his writings have been contributed to the
Monist and Open Court. He is the author of a work on psychical research,
entitled “Hours with the Ghosts,” published in 1897, and many brochures on
magic and mysticism, etc.</p>

<p class="pfirst">
The very word magic has an alluring sound, and its practice as an art will
probably never lose its attractiveness for people’s
minds. But we must remember that there is a difference between
the old magic and the new, and that both are separated by a
deep chasm, which is a kind of color line, for though the latter
develops from the former in a gradual and natural course of
evolution, they are radically different in principle, and the new
magic is irredeemably opposed to the assumptions upon which
the old magic rests.</p>

<p>Magic originally meant priestcraft. It is probable that the
word is very old, being handed down to us from the Greeks
and Romans, who had received it from the Persians. But they
in their turn owe it to the Babylonians, and the Babylonians to
the Assyrians, and the Assyrians to the Sumero-Akkadians.</p>

<p><i>Imga</i> in Akkad meant priest, and the Assyrians changed
the word to <i>maga</i>, calling their high-priest <i>Rab-mag</i>; and considering
the fact that the main business of priests in ancient
times consisted in exorcising, fortune-telling, miracle-working,
and giving out oracles, it seems justifiable to believe that the
Persian term, which in its Latin version is <i>magus</i>, is derived
from the Chaldæan and is practically the same; for the connotation
of a wise man endowed with supernatural powers has
always been connected with the word <i>magus</i>, and even to-day
magician means wizard, sorcerer, or miracle-worker.
<span class="xxpn" id="p-x">{x}</span></p>

<p>While the belief in, and practice of, magic are not entirely
absent in the civilization of Israel, we find that the leaders of
orthodox thought had set their faces against it, at least as it
appeared in its crudest form, and went so far as to persecute
sorcerers with fire and sword.</p>

<p>We read in the Bible that when the Lord “multiplied his
signs” in Egypt, he sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh to turn
their rods into serpents, that the Egyptian magicians vied with
them in the performance, but that Aaron’s rod swallowed up
their rods, demonstrating thus Aaron’s superiority. It is an
interesting fact that the snake charmers of Egypt perform to-day
a similar feat, which consists in paralyzing a snake so as to
render it motionless. The snake then looks like a stick, but is
not rigid. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xi">{xi}</span></p>

<p>How tenacious the idea is that religion is and must be magic,
appears from the fact that even Christianity shows traces of it.
In fact, the early Christians (who, we must remember, recruited
their ranks from the lowly in life) looked upon Christ as a kind
of magician, and all his older pictures show him with a magician’s
wand in his hand. The resurrection of Lazarus, the
change of water into wine, the miracle of the loaves and fishes,
the healing of diseases by casting out devils, and kindred miracles,
according to the notions of those centuries, are performed
after the fashion of sorcerers.</p>

<p>The adjoined illustration, one of
the oldest representations of Christ,
has been reproduced from Rossi’s
<i>Roma Sotterranea</i> (II, Table 14). It
is a fresco of the catacombs, discovered
in the St. Callisto Chapel, and is dated
by Franz Xaver Kraus (<i>Geschichte
der christlichen Kunst, I, p. 153</i>) at
the beginning of the third century.
Jesus holds in his left hand the scriptures,
while his right hand grasps the
wand with which he performs the
miracle. Lazarus is represented as a
mummy, while one of his sisters kneels
at the Saviour’s feet.</p>

<p>Goethe introduces the belief in magic into the very plot of
Faust. In his despair at never finding the key to the world-problem
in science, which, as he thinks, does not offer what we
need, but useless truisms only, Faust hopes to find the royal
road to knowledge by supernatural methods. He says:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpp00">That many a secret perchance I reach</div>

<p>Faust follows the will o’ the wisp of pseudo-science, and so
finds his efforts to gain useful knowledge balked. He turns
agnostic and declares that we cannot know anything worth knowing.
He exclaims:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>That
 which we do not know is dearly needed;</div>
<div class="dpp00">And what we need we do not know.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And in another place:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>I
 see that nothing can be known.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>But, having acquired a rich store of experience, Faust, at the
end of his career, found out that the study of nature is not a
useless rummage in empty words, and became converted to
science. His ideal is a genuinely scientific view of nature. He
says:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Not
 yet have I my liberty made good:</div>
<div class="dpp00">So long as I can’t banish magic’s fell creations</div>
<div class="dpp00">And totally unlearn the incantations.</div>
<div class="dpp00">Stood I, O Nature, as a man in thee,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Then were it worth one’s while a man to be.</div>
<div class="dpp00">And such was I ere I with the occult conversed,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And ere so wickedly the world I cursed.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>To be a man in nature and to fight one’s way to liberty is a
much more dignified position than to go lobbying to the courts
of the celestials and to beg of them favors. Progress does not
pursue a straight line, but moves in spirals or epicycles. Periods
of daylight are followed by nights of super­sti­tion. So it happened
that in the first and second decades of the nineteenth
century the rationalism of the eighteenth century waned, not to
make room for a higher rationalism, but to suffer the old bugbears
of ghosts and hobgoblins to reappear in a reactionary movement.
Faust (expressing here Goethe’s own ideas) continues:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Now
 fills the air so many a haunting shape,</div>
<div class="dpp00">That no one knows how best he may escape.</div>
<div class="dpp00">What though the day with rational splendor beams,</div>
<div class="dpp00">The night entangles us in webs of dreams.</div>
<div class="dpp00">By super­sti­tion constantly ensnared,</div>
<div class="dpp00">It spooks, gives warnings, is declared.</div>
<div class="dpp00">Intimidated thus we stand alone.</div>
<div class="dpp00">The portal jars, yet entrance is there none.”</div>
</div></div>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-xv">{xv}</span></div>

<p>The aim of man is his liberty and independence. As soon
as we understand that there are no spooks that must be conciliated
by supplications and appeased, but that we stand in nature
from which we have grown in constant interaction between our
own aspirations and the natural forces regulated by law, we
shall have confidence in our own faculties, which can be increased
by investigation and a proper comprehension of conditions, and
we shall no longer look beyond but around. Faust says:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>A
 fool who to the Beyond his eyes directeth</div>
<div class="dpp00">And over the clouds a place of peers detecteth.</div>
<div class="dpp00">Firm must man stand and look around him well,</div>
<div class="dpp00">The world means something to the capable.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This manhood of man, to be gained by science through the
conquest of all magic, is the ideal which the present age is striving
to attain, and the ideal has plainly been recognized by leaders
of human progress. The time has come for us “to put away
childish things,” and to relinquish the beliefs and practices of
the medicine-man.</p>

<p>The old magic is sorcery, or, considering the impossibility
of genuine sorcery, the attempt to practise sorcery. It is based
upon the pre-scientific world-conception, which in its primitive
stage is called animism, imputing to nature a spiritual life analogous
to our own spirit, and peopling the world with individual
personalities, spirits, ghosts, goblins, gods, devils, ogres, gnomes
and fairies. The old magic stands in contrast to science; it
endeavors to transcend human knowledge by supernatural methods
and is based upon the hope of working miracles by the
assistance of invisible presences or intelligences, who, according
to this belief, could be forced or coaxed by magic into an alliance.
The savage believes that the evil influence of the powers
of nature can be averted by charms or talismans, and their aid
procured by proper incantations, conjurations and prayers.</p>

<p>The world-conception of the savage is long-lingering, and
its influence does not subside instantaneously with the first
appearance of science. The Middle Ages are full of magic, and
the belief in it has not died out to this day.</p>

<p>The old magic found a rival in science and has in all its
aspects, in religion as well as in occultism, in mysticism and
obscurantism, treated science as its hereditary enemy.
It is now <span class="xxpn" id="p-xvi">{xvi}</span>
succumbing in the fight, but in the meantime a new magic has
originated and taken the place of the old, performing miracles
as wonderful as those of the best conjurers of former days, nay,
more wonderful; yet these miracles are accomplished with the
help of science and without the least pretense of supernatural
power.</p>

<p>The new magic originated from the old magic when the
belief in sorcery began to break down in the eighteenth century,
which is the dawn of rationalism and marks the epoch since
which mankind has been systematically working out a scientific
world-conception.</p>

<p>In primitive society religion is magic, and priests are magicians.
The savage would think that if the medicine-man could
not work miracles there would be no use for religion. Religion,
however, does not disappear with the faith in the medicine-man’s
power. When magic becomes discredited by science, religion
is purified. We must know, though, that religious reforms of
this kind are not accomplished at once, but come on gradually in
slow process of evolution, first by disappointment and then in
exultation at the thought that the actualities of science are
higher, nobler and better than the dreams of super­sti­tion, even
if they were possible, and thus it appears that science comes to
fulfil, not to destroy.</p>

<p>Science has been pressed into the service of magic by ancient
pagan priests, who utilized mechanical contrivances in their
temples to impress the credulous with the supernatural power
of their gods.</p>

<p>The magic lantern, commonly supposed to be an invention of the
Jesuit Kircher, in 1671, must have been secretly known among the
few members of the craft of scientific magic at least as early
as the end of the middle ages, for we have an old drawing, which
is here reproduced, showing that it was employed in warfare as
a means of striking terror in the ranks of the enemy. We have
no information as to the success of the stratagem, but we may
assume that in the days of a common belief in witchcraft and
absolute ignorance of the natural sciences, it must have been
quite effective with super­sti­tious soldiers <span class="xxpn"

possesses no lens, the picture being drawn in an
upright position upon cylindrical glass, presumably
blackened with the exception of the figure. So
far as known this is the oldest record of the use
of the magic lantern.</p>

<p>Fontana’s lantern was used, as F. M. Feldhaus informs us
(Gartenlaube, 1905, Nov. 23, p. 848) by the <i>encignerius</i> or
<i>antwere maister</i>, i. e., the master of siege and fortress
defenses, who from an appropriate hiding-place projected the image
upon a convenient wall in the outside works of a fort so as to let
assailants unexpectedly be confronted with the hideous form of a
demon.]</p></div><!--dcaption-->

<p class="padtopb">While
magic as super­sti­tion and as fraud is doomed, magic
as an art will not die. Science will take hold of it and permeate
it with its own spirit, changing it into scientific magic which is
destitute of all mysticism, occultism and super­sti­tion, and comes
to us as a witty play for our recreation and diversion.</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary help to a man to be acquainted with
the tricks of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teurs, and we advise parents not to neglect
this phase in the education of their children. The present
age is laying the basis of a scientific world-conception, and it is,
perhaps, not without good reasons that it has produced quite a
literature on the subject of modern magic.</p>

<p>It might seem that if the public became familiar with the
methods of the magicians who give public entertainments, their
business would be gone. But this is not the case. As a peep
behind the scenes and a knowledge of the machinery of the
stage only help us to appreciate scenic effects, so an insight into
the tricks of the pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur will only serve to whet our
appetite for seeing him perform his tricks. The pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur
will be forced to improve his tricks before an intelligent audience;
he will be obliged to invent new methods, but not to
abandon his art.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is not the trick alone that we admire, but the
way in which it is performed. Even those who know how things
can be made to disappear by sleight of hand, must confess that
they always found delight in seeing the late Alexander Herrmann,
whenever he began a soirée, take off his gloves, roll them
up and make them vanish as if into nothingness.</p>

<p>It is true that magic in the old sense is gone; but that need
not be lamented. The coarseness of Cagliostro’s frauds has
given way to the elegant display of scientific inventiveness and
an adroit use of human wit. Traces of the religion of magic are
still prevalent to-day, and it will take much patient work before
the last remnants of it are swept away. The notions of magic
still hold in bondage the minds of the uneducated and half-educated,
and even the leaders of progress feel themselves now
and then hampered by ghosts and super­sti­tions.</p>

<p>We believe that the spread of modern magic and its proper
comprehension are an important sign of progress,
and in this <span class="xxpn" id="p-xix">{xix}</span>
sense the feats of our Kellars and Herrmanns are a work of
religious significance. They are instrumental in dispelling the
fogs of super­sti­tion by exhibiting to the public the astonishing
but natural miracles of the art of legerdemain; and while they
amuse and entertain they fortify the people in their conviction
of the reliability of science.</p>

<div class="dfloatright dwth-g"><img src="images/i000-19.png"

<span class="smcap">Z<b>ÖLLNER’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>LLUSION</b></span></div></div>

<p>In speaking of modern magic, we refer to the art of the
pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur, and exclude from its domain the experiments
of hypnotism as well as the vulgar lies of fraud. There is no
magic in the psychosis of an hysterical subject, who at the
hypnotizer’s suggestion becomes the prey of hal­luc­i­na­tions; nor
is there any art in the deceptions of the fortune-teller, whose
business will vanish when the public ceases to be credulous and
super­sti­tious. The former is a disease, the latter mostly fraud.
Magic proper (i. e., the artifices of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion) is produced
by a combination of three factors: (1) legerdemain
proper, or sleight of hand; (2) psy­cho­log­i­cal illusions, and (3)
surprising feats of natural science with clever concealment of
their true causes. The success of almost every trick depends
upon the introduction of these three factors.</p>

<p>The throwing of cards is mere dexterity; Zöllner’s famous
figures of parallel lines having an apparent
inclination toward <span class="xxpn" id="p-xx">{xx}</span>
one another is a pure sense-illusion (see cut here reproduced);
so is the magical swing; while fire-eating (or better, fire-breathing)
is a purely physical experiment. But it goes without saying
that there is scarcely any performance of genuine pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion
which is not a combination of all three elements. The
production of a bowl of water with living fishes in it is a combination
of dexterity with psychology.</p>

<p>The trick with the glass dial (which is now exhibited by
both Mr. Kellar and Mr. Herrmann, the nephew of the late
Alexander Herrmann) is purely physical. The machinery used
by them is entirely different, but in either case no sleight of hand
nor any psy­cho­log­i­cal diversion is needed, except in letting the
accomplice behind the stage know the number to which he should
point.</p>

<p>As an instance of a wonderful trick which is a mere sense-illusion
we mention the magic swing, which is explained by
Albert A. Hopkins in his comprehensive book on magic<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">1</a>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Those who are to participate in the apparent gyrations of the swing—and
there may be quite a number who enjoy it simultaneously—are ushered into a
small room. From a bar crossing the room, near the ceiling, hangs a large
swing, which is provided with seats for a number of people. After the people
have taken their places, the attendant pushes the car and it starts into oscillation
like any other swing. The room door is closed. Gradually those in it
feel after three or four movements that their swing is going rather high, but
this is not all. The apparent amplitude of the oscillations increases more and
more, until presently the whole swing seems to whirl completely over, describing
a full circle about the bar on which it hangs. To make the thing more
utterly mysterious, the bar is bent crank fashion, the swing continues apparently
to go round and round this way, imparting a most weird sensation to
the occupants, until its movements begin gradually to cease and the complete
rotation is succeeded by the usual back and forth swinging. The door of the
room is opened, and the swinging party leave. Those who have tried it say the
sensation is most peculiar.</p>

<p>“The illusion is based on the movements of the room proper. During the
entire exhibition the swing is practically stationary, while the room rotates
about the suspending bar. At the beginning of operations the swing may be
given a slight push; the operators outside the room then begin to swing the
room itself, which is really a large box journaled on
the swing bar, starting <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxi">{xxi}</span>
it off to correspond with the movements of the swing. They swing it back
and forth, increasing the arc through which it moves until it goes so far as
to make a complete rotation. The operatives do this without special machinery,
taking hold of the sides and corners of the box or ‘room.’ At this
time the people in the swing imagine that the room is stationary while they
are whirling through space. After keeping this up for some time, the movement
is brought gradually to a stop, a sufficient number of back and forth
swings being given at the <i>finale</i> to carry out the illusion
to the end.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“The room is as completely furnished as possible, everything being, of
course, fastened in place. What is apparently a kerosene lamp stands on a
table, near at hand. It is securely fastened to the table, which in its turn is
fastened to the floor, and the light is supplied by a small incandescent lamp
within the chimney, but concealed by the shade. The visitor never imagines
that it is an electric lamp, and naturally thinks that it would be impossible
for a kerosene lamp to be inverted without disaster, so that this adds to the
deception materially. The same is to be said of the pictures
hanging on the <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxiii">{xxiii}</span>
wall, of the cupboard full of chinaware, of the chair with a hat on it, and of
the baby carriage. All contribute to the mystification. Even though one is
informed of the secret before entering the swing, the deception is said to be
so complete that passengers involuntarily seize the arms of the seats to avoid
being precipitated below.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The illusion is purely an instance of misguided judgment,
which is commonly but erroneously called illusion of the senses,
and belongs to the same category as the well-known Zöllner
figures mentioned above and consisting of heavy lines crossed
slantingly by lighter lines. The heavy lines are parallel but
appear to diverge in the direction of the slant.</p>

back, yet leaving the man uninjured. Since the audience naturally
will suspect that the point emerging from the back is not
the true end of the sword, the trick has been altered to the
effect of replacing the sword with a big needle (A), having tape
threaded through its eye. When the assassin’s needle has passed
through the victim, it can be pulled out at the other side, together
with the tape, where it appears reddened with blood. The stabbing,
when performed quickly, before the
spectator begins to <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxiv">{xxiv}</span>
notice that the blade is somewhat reduced in size, is most startling,
and makes a deep impression on the audience; but the artifice
through which the manipulation is rendered possible is
very simple. The sword, or needle, used for the purpose, is
made of a very thin and flexible plate of steel, sufficiently blunt
to prevent it from doing any harm. The victim, as if trying
to ward off the dangerous weapon, takes hold of it and causes
it to slip into the opening of a concealed sheath (B), which he
carries strapped around his body, whereupon the assassin makes
his thrust. The interior of the sheath contains a red fluid, which
dyes the blade and helps to make the deception complete. The
accompanying illustration sufficiently explains the performance.</p>

<hr class="hr30" />

<p>While the performance of magical tricks is an art, the observation
of them and also their description is a science, presupposing
a quick and critical eye, of which very few people are
possessed; and scientists by profession are sometimes the least
fit persons to detect the place and mode of the deception.</p>

<p>How differently different persons watch the same events becomes
apparent when we compare Professor Zöllner’s reports of
spiritualistic séances with those of other more critical wit­nes­ses.
Pro­fessor Zöllner, for instance, writes (<i>Wis­sen­schaft­liche Ab­handl.</i>,
Vol. III, p. 354) in his description of one of the experiments
with the famous American medium, Dr. Slade, that Professor
Fechner’s chair was lifted up about half a foot above the
ground, while Dr. Slade touched the back of it lightly with his
hand, and he emphasizes that his colleague, after hovering some
time in the air, was suddenly dropped with great noise. The
event as thus described is mystifying. However, when we carefully
compare Professor Fechner’s account, we come to the
conclusion that the whole proceeding is no longer miraculous,
but could be repeated by pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teurs. Fechner writes that
at the request of Dr. Slade, he himself (Professor Fechner),
who was slim and light, took the place of Professor Braune.
Dr. Slade turned round to Professor Fechner and bore his chair
upward in a way which is not at all inexplicable by the methods
of legerdemain. Professor Fechner does not mention that he
hovered for some time in the air, but it is obvious
that Dr. Slade <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxv">{xxv}</span>
made the two professors change seats because he would scarcely
have had the strength to lift up the heavy Professor Braune.</p>

<p>Similarly, the accounts of the famous painter, Gabriel Max,
who also attended some of Slade’s séances with Zöllner, make
the performances of the medium appear in a
less wonderful light. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxvi">{xxvi}</span></p>

<p>Mr. Carl Willmann, a manufacturer of magical apparatus at
Hamburg, and the author of several books on modern magic,
publishes a circumstantial description of Professor Zöllner’s
double slates used in séances with Dr. Slade, which are now in
possession of Dr. Borcherdt of Hamburg, who bought them,
with other objects of interest, from the estate of the deceased
Professor Zöllner. The seals of these slates are by no means
so intact as not to arouse the suspicion that they have been
tampered with. To a superficial inspection they appear unbroken,
but the sealing wax shows vestiges of finger marks, and Mr.
Willmann has not the slightest doubt that the slates were opened
underneath the seals with a thin heated wire, and that the seals
were afterwards replaced.</p>

<p>Professor Zöllner, the most famous victim of the bold medium,
lacked entirely the necessary critical faculty, and became
an easy prey of fraud. One of his colleagues, a professor of
surgery in the University of Leipsic, had entered upon a bet
with Professor Zöllner that a slate carefully sealed and watched
by himself could not be written upon by spirits; he had left the
slate in Professor Zöllner’s hands in the confidence that the latter
would use all necessary precautions. Professor Zöllner, however,
not finding Dr. Slade at home, saw nothing wrong in
leaving the sealed slate at the medium’s residence and thus allowing
it to pass for an indefinite time out of his own control, thinking
that the seals were a sufficient protection. It goes without
saying that his colleague at once cancelled the bet and took no
more interest in the experiment. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxvii">{xxvii}</span></p>

<p>The foot and hand prints which Dr. Slade produced were
apparently made from celluloid impressions, which could easily
be carried about and hidden in the pocket. This explains why
these vestiges of the spirit were not of the size of Dr. Slade’s
hands or feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Willmann calls attention to the fact that the footprints,
as published by Professor Zöllner, were made from feet whose
stockings had been removed but a few moments before, for
they still show the meshes of the knitting which quickly disappear
as soon as the skin of the foot grows cold. Professor Zöllner
did not see such trifles, and yet they are important, even if it
were for the mere purpose of determining whether the spirits
wear stockings made in Germany or America.</p>

<hr class="hr30" />

<p>The accounts of travelers are, as a rule, full of extravagant
praise of the accomplishments of foreign magicians; thus, the
feats of our American Indians are almost habitually greatly
exaggerated. The same is true in a greater measure of fakirs
and Hindu magicians. Recent accounts of a famous traveler
are startling, but the problem is not whether or not what he
tells is true (for only a little dose of good judgment is sufficient
to recognize their impossibility), but whether or not he believes
his tales himself. The problem is neither physical nor historical
as to the reality of the events narrated; the problem is purely
psy­cho­log­i­cal as to his own state of mind.</p>

<p>The primitive simplicity of the methods of the Hindu jugglers
and the openness of the theatre where they perform their
tricks cause wonderment to those who are not familiar with
the methods of legerdemain. Mr. Willmann, who had occasion
to watch Hindu magicians, says in his book, <i>Moderne Wunder</i>,
page 3: “After a careful investigation, it becomes apparent that
the greatest miracles of Indian conjurers are much more insignificant
than they appear in the latest reports of travelers. The
descriptions which in our days men of science have furnished
about the wonderful tricks of fakirs, have very little value in the
shape in which they are rendered. If they, for instance, speak
with admiration about the invisible growth of a flower before
their very eyes, produced from the seed
deposited by a fakir in <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxviii">{xxviii}</span>
a flower-pot, they prove only that even men of science can be
duped by a little trick the practice of which lies without the pale
of their own experience.”</p>

<p>Eye-witnesses whose critical capacities are a safeguard against
imposition, relate more plausible stories. John T. McCutcheon
describes the famous trick of growing a mango tree, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The further away from India one is the greater appears the skill of these
Hindu magicians. How often have we read the traveler’s tales about the
feats of Indian jugglers, and how eagerly we have looked forward to the time
when we might behold them and be spellbound with amazement and surprise.
When I first saw the Indian juggler beginning the preparations for the mango
trick I was half prepared by the traveler’s tales to see a graceful tree spring
quickly into life and subsequently see somebody climb it and pick quantities
of nice, ripe mangoes. Nothing of the kind happened, as will be seen by the
following description of the mango trick as it is really performed:</p>

<div class="dctr05"><img src="images/i000-28.png"

<span class="smcap">B<b>EN</b>-K<b>I</b>-B<b>EY.</b></span>
<br />(After Carl Willmann.)</div></div>

<p>“The juggler, with a big bag of properties, arrived on the scene and immediately
began to talk excitedly, meanwhile unpacking various receptacles
taken from the bag. He squatted down, piped a few notes on a wheezy reed
whistle and the show began. From his belongings he took a little tin can
about the size of a cove oyster can, filled it with dirt and saturated the dirt
with water. Then he held up a mango seed to show that there was nothing
concealed by his sleeves; counted ‘ek, do, tin, char,’ or ‘one, two, three, four,’
and imbedded the seed in the moist earth. He spread a large cloth over the
can and several feet of circumjacent ground. Then he played a few more
notes on his reed instrument and allowed the seed a few minutes in which
to take root and develop into a glorious shade tree. While
he was waiting he <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxix">{xxix}</span>
unfolded some snakes from a small basket, took a mongoose from a bag and
entertained his audience with a combat between the mongoose and one of
the snakes.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Ek, do, tin, char; one, two, three, four—plenty fight—very good mongoose—biga
snake—four rupee mongoose—two rupee snake—mongoose fight
snake. Look—gentlymans—plenty big fight.’</p>

<div class="dctr01"><img src="images/i000-29.jpg"

<span class="smcap">C<b>HARMERS.</b></span> (From Brehm.)</div></div>

<p>“All this time the cloth remained peaceful and quiet, and there were no
uneasy move­ments of its folds to indicate that the mango crop was flourishing.
The juggler now turned his attention to it, however, poked his hands under
the cloth, and after a few seconds of mysterious fumbling triumphantly threw
off the cloth, and lo! there was a little bunch of leaves about as big as a sprig
of water cress sticking up dejectedly from the damp earth. This was straightway
deluged with some water and the cloth again thrown over it.</p>

<p>“Once more there was a diversion. This time an exhibition of a shell
game, in which the juggler showed considerable dexterity in placing the little
ball where you didn’t think it would be. Still the cloth revealed no disposition
to bulge skyward, and a second time the juggler fumbled under it, talking
hurriedly in Hindustani and making the occasion as interesting as possible.
After much poking around he finally threw off the cloth with a glad cry, and
there was a mango tree a foot high, with adult leaves which glistened with
moisture. When his spectators had gazed at it for awhile he pulled the little
tree up by the roots, and there was a mango seed attached, with the little
sprouts springing out from it.</p>

<p>“The trick was over, the juggler’s harvest of rupees and annas began, and
soon his crowd faded away. A few minutes later, from
a half-hidden seat <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxx">{xxx}</span>
on the hotel veranda, I saw the wizard over across the street, beneath the big
shade trees, folding up the mango tree and tucking it compactly into a
small bag.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To conjure ghosts has always been the highest ambition of
performers of magical tricks, and we know that the magic lantern
has been used for this purpose since mediæval days, but
modern necromancy has been brought to perfection by Robertson
and Pepper, through the invention of a simple contrivance,
known under the name of Pepper’s ghost, by which impalpable
specters become plainly visible to the astonished eyes of the
spectators.</p>

<p>For a description of these performances, as well as many
other feats in the same line, we refer to Mr. Evans’ fascinating
explanations in the body of the present volume.</p>

<p>Tricks performed by mediums are in one respect quite different
from the feats of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teurs; if they come up to the
standards, they are, or might be, based upon the psychic dispositions
of people. Believers will gladly be caught in the traps set
for them and are, as a rule, grateful for the deception, while
determined unbelievers will either prove altogether hopeless or
will become so bewildered as to be likely to become believers.
Sleight of hand is always a valuable aid to the medium; but,
as tricks pure and simple, mediumistic séances are not different
from the performances of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teurs, and differ only in
this, that they claim to be done with the assistance of spirits.
Mediums must be on the lookout and use different methods as
the occasion may require. They produce rappings with their
hands or their feet,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">3</a>
or with mechanical devices hidden in their
shoes; neither do they scorn the use of rapping tables with concealed
batteries and electric wires.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc2" id="fn2">2</a>
Chicago Record, April 22, 1899.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc3" id="fn3">3</a>
One of the Fox sisters could produce rappings through
a peculiar construction of the bones of her foot, and Cumberland’s
big toe was blessed with a tendon of its own, enabling him to rap
the floor quite vigorously without being detected.</p></div>

<p>The instances here adduced are sufficient to show that even
the most complete deceptions admit of explanations which, in
many instances, are much simpler than the
spectators think. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxxi">{xxxi}</span>
Neither the marvelous feats of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teurs nor the surprising
revelations of mediums should shake our confidence in science
or make us slaves of super­sti­tion. The success of modern magic,
which accomplishes more than the old magic or sorcery ever did,
is a sufficient guarantee of the reliability of reason, and even
where “now we see through a glass darkly,” we must remain
confident that when we grow in wisdom and comprehension
we shall learn to see “face to face.”</p>

<p>For all these reasons, knowledge of magic and its history,
the false pretenses of the old magic and the brilliant success
of modern magic should have a place in our educational program.
I do not advocate its introduction into schools, but would
recommend parents to let their children become acquainted with
the remarkable performances of the best and greatest among modern
magicians. We all should know something of the general methods of
magic, and some time in our lives witness the <span class="xxpn"
id="p-xxxii">{xxxii}</span> extraordinary feats, bordering on
miracles, with which a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur can dazzle our eyes and
misguide our judgment.</p>

<p>Modern magic is not merely a diversion or a recreation,
but may become possessed of a deeper worth when it broadens
our insight into the rich possibilities of mystification, while a
peep behind the scenes will keep us sober and prevent us from
falling a prey to super­sti­tion.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">The art of natural magic dates back to the remotest antiquity.
There is an Egyptian papyrus<a class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">4</a>
in the British Museum which
chronicles a magical seance given by a certain Tchatcha-em-ankh
before King Khufu, B. C. 3766. The manuscript says of the
wizard: “He knoweth how to bind on a head which hath been
cut off; he knoweth how to make a lion follow him as if led by
a rope; and he knoweth the number of the stars of the house
(constellation) of Thoth.” It will be seen from this that the
decapitation trick was in vogue ages ago, while the experiment
with the lion, which is unquestionably a hypnotic feat, shows
hypnotism to be very ancient indeed. Ennemoser, in his <i>History
of Magic</i>, devotes considerable space to Egyptian thaumaturgy,
especially to the wonders wrought by animal magnetism, which
in the hands of the priestly hierarchy must have been miracles
indeed to the uninitiated. All that was known of
science was in <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
possession of the guardians of the temples, who frequently used
their knowledge of natural phenomena to gain ascendancy over
the ignorant multitude.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc4" id="fn4">4</a>
Westcar papyrus, XVIII dynasty; about B. C. 1550.
In this ancient manuscript are stories which date from the early
empire. “They are as old,” says Budge (<i>Egyptian Magic</i>, London,
1899), “as the Great Pyramid.”</p></div>

<p>An acquaintance with stage machinery and the science of
optics and acoustics was necessary to the production of the many
marvelous effects exhibited. Every temple in Egypt and Greece
was a veritable storehouse of natural magic. Thanks to ancient
writers like Heron of Alexandria, Philo of Byzantium, and the
Fathers of the early Christian Church, we are able to fathom
some of the secrets of the old thaumaturgists. The magi of the
temples were adepts in the art of phan­tas­ma­goria. In the ancient
temple of Hercules at Tyre, Pliny states that there was a seat of
consecrated stone “from which the gods easily rose.”</p>

<p>In the temple at Tarsus, Esculapius showed himself to the
devout. Damascius says: “In a manifestation, which ought not
to be revealed, .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. there appeared on the wall of a temple a
mass of light, which at first seemed to be very remote; it transformed
itself, in coming nearer, into a face evidently divine and
supernatural, of severe aspect, but mixed with gentleness and
extremely beautiful. According to the institutions of a mysterious
religion the Alexandrians honored it as Osiris and Adonis.”</p>

<p>By means of concave mirrors, made of highly polished metal,
the priests were able to project images upon walls, in the air, or
upon the smoke arising from burning incense. In speaking of
the art of casting specula of persons upon smoke, the ingenious
Salverte says: “The Theurgists caused the appearance of the
gods in the air in the midst of gaseous vapors disengaged from
fire. Porphyrus admires this secret; Iamblichus censures the
employment of it, but he confesses its existence and grants it to
be worthy the attention of the inquirer after truth. The Theurgist
Maximus undoubtedly made use of a secret analogous to
this, when, in the fumes of the incense which he burned before
the statute of Hecate, the image was seen to laugh so naturally
as to fill the spectators with terror.”</p>

<p>A. Rich, in his <i>Dictionary of Roman and Greek Antiquities</i>,
relates, under the heading of the word “Adytum,” that many
of the ancient temples possessed chambers the existence of which
was known only to the priests, and which
served for the <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
production of their illusions. He visited one at Alba, upon the lake of
Fucius. It was located amid the ruins of a temple, and was in
a perfect state of preservation. This chamber of mysteries was
formed under the apsis—that is to say, under the large semi-circular
niche which usually sheltered the image of the god, at
the far extremity of the edifice. “One part of this chamber,”
says he, “is sunk beneath the pavement of the principal part of
the temple (<i>cella</i>) and the other rises above it. The latter,
then, must have appeared to the worshipers gathered together
in the temple merely like a base that occupied the lower portion
of the apsis, and that was designed to hold in an elevated position
the statue of the god or goddess whose name was borne by
the edifice. This sanctuary, moreover, had no door or visible
com­mu­ni­ca­tion that opened into the body of the building. Entrance
therein was effected through a secret door in an enclosure
of walls at the rear of the temple. It was through this that the
priests introduced themselves and their machinery without being
observed by the <i>hoi polloi</i>. But there is one remarkable fact
that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt the purpose of the
adytum. One discovers here a number of tubes or pipes which
pierce the walls between the hiding-place and the interior of the
temple. These tubes debouch at different places in the partitions
of the cella, and thus permit a voice to be heard in any part
of the building, while the person and place from which the sound
issues remain unknown to the auditors.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the adytum was simply a chamber situated behind
the apsis, as in a small temple which was still in existence at
Rome in the sixteenth century. An architect named Labbacco
has left us a description of the edifice. Travelers who have
visited the remains of the temple of Ceres, at Eleusis, have
observed a curious fact. The pavement of the cella is rough and
unpolished, and much lower than the level of the adjacent porch,
thereby indicating that a wooden floor, on a level with the portico,
covered the present floor, and hid from view a secret vault
designed to operate the machinery that moved the flooring.
This view is confirmed by vertical and horizontal grooves, and
the holes constructed in the side walls. Similar contrivances
existed in India. Philostratus, in his <i>Life of
Apollonius</i> (1, III, <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
Ch. v), says: “The Indian sages conducted Apollonius toward
the temple of their god, marching in solemn procession and singing
sacred hymns. Occasionally they would strike the earth in
cadence with their staves, whereupon the ground moved like a
sea in turmoil, now rising with them to the height of almost
two feet, then subsiding to its regular level.” The blows from
the wands were evidently the cue for the concealed assistants to
operate the machinery that moved the soil. Says Brown, in his
<i>Stellar Theology</i>: “Among the buildings uncovered at Pompeii
is a temple of Isis, which is a telltale of the mysteries of the
Egyptian deity, for the secret stair which conducted the priests
unseen to an opening back of the statue of the goddess, through
whose marble lips pretended oracles were given and warnings
uttered, now lies open to the day, and reveals the whole imposition.”</p>

<p>The Bible has preserved to us the story of the struggle of
Daniel with the priests of Bel, in which the secret door played
its part. The Hebrew prophet refused to worship the idol Bel,
whereupon the King said to him: “Doth not Bel seem to thee
to be a living god? Seest thou not how much he eateth and
drinketh every day?” Then Daniel smiled and said: “O King,
be not deceived; for this is but clay within and brass without,
neither hath he eaten at any time.” The King sent for his priests
and demanded the truth of them, declaring his intention of putting
them to the sword should they fail to demonstrate the fact
that the god really consumed the offerings of meat and wine.
And the priests of Bel said: “Behold, we go out; and do thou,
O King, set on the meats, and make ready the wine, and shut
the door fast, and seal it with thy own ring. And when thou
comest in the morning, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten
up all, we will suffer death, or else Daniel that hath lied against
us.” And they “little regarded it, because they had made under
the table a secret entrance, and they always came in by it, and
consumed those things.”</p>

<p>Daniel detected the imposture in a very original manner.
He caused ashes to be sifted upon the floor of the temple,
whereby the footsteps of the false priests were made manifest to
the enraged King of Babylon. <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span></p>

<p>One reads in Pausanias (<i>Arcadia</i>, 1 VIII, Ch. xvi) that at
Jerusalem the sepulcher of a woman of that country, named
Helena, had a door which was of marble like the rest of the
monument, and that this door opened of itself on a certain day
of the year, and at a certain hour, by means of concealed
machinery, thus antedating our time-locks. Eventually it closed
itself. “At any other time,” adds the author, “if you had desired
to open it, you would have more easily broken it.”</p>

<p>When Aeneas went to consult the Cumæan Sibyl, the hundred
doors of the sanctuary opened of themselves, in order that
the oracle might be heard.</p>

APPARATUS FOR BLOWING A TRUMPET ON OPENING
A DOOR.</div></div>

<p>According to Pliny, the doors of the labyrinth of Thebes
were constructed in such a manner that when they were opened
a sound resembling that of thunder greeted the astonished worshipers.</p>

<p>Heron, in his <i>Pneumatics</i>, describes an apparatus for blowing
a trumpet on opening the door of a temple, the effect of which
must have been awe inspiring to the uninitiated common people.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to give a detailed translation of the
text of the Greek engineer, as the <i>modus operandi</i> of the experiment
is sufficiently explained by reference
to the descriptive <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
picture. It will suffice to add: One sees that when the door of
the temple is opened, a system of cords, rods and pulleys causes
a hemispherical cap, to the upper part of which the trumpet is
attached, to sink into a vase full of water. The air compressed
by the water escapes through the instrument, causing it to sound.</p>

<p>Another remarkable device is described in the <i>Pneumatics</i>
of Heron, and consists of an apparatus which is entitled: “<i>Construction
of a chapel wherein, when fire is lighted upon the altar,
the doors open, and when it is
extinguished, they close</i>.” <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span></p>

<p>The altar is hollow, and when a fire is lighted thereon, the
air contained in the interior expands and begins to press upon
the water with which the globe situated beneath is filled. The
water then rises through a bent tube which leads to a species of
pot, into which it falls. The pot is suspended upon a cord which
passes along a pulley, doubling immediately, in order to enroll
itself about two cylinders, which turn upon pivots, said cylinders
forming the prolongation of the axes upon which the doors
above turn. Around the same cylinders are enrolled in a contrary
manner, two other cords, which also unite into one before
passing along a pulley, and then hanging vertically for the support
of a counterpoise.</p>

<p>It is clear that when the water from the globe enters the
pot, the weight of the latter will be augmented and it will sink,
pulling upon the cord which has been wound
about the cylinders <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
in such a way as to cause the doors to open, when it is drawn in
this direction.</p>

<p>The doors close themselves in the following manner: The
bent tube, which places in com­mu­ni­ca­tion the globe and the
pot, forms a siphon, the longest branch of which plunges into
the globe. When the fire is extinguished upon the altar, the
air contained in the latter and in the globe, cools, and diminishes
in volume. The water in the pot is then drawn into the globe,
and the siphon, being thus naturally influenced, operates until
the water in the pot has passed over into the globe. In measure
as the pot lightens, it remounts under the constraint of the counterpoise,
and the latter, in its descent, closes the doors through
the intermedium of the cords wound around the cylinders.</p>

HOW THE STATUES WERE MADE TO POUR LIBATIONS WHEN
A FIRE WAS KINDLED ON THE ALTAR.</div></div>

<p>Heron says that mercury was sometimes used in place of
water, by reason of its superior weight. <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span></p>

<p>Certain altars were provided with such mechanism as to
afford to the faithful even more astonishing spectacles. Here is
another experiment from the learned Heron:</p>

<p>“<i>To construct an altar so that when one kindles the fire
thereon, the statues which are at the sides shall pour out libations</i>.”</p>

<p>There should be a pedestal, upon which are placed the statues,
and an altar closed on all sides. The pedestal should communicate
with the altar through a central tube, also with the statues
by means of tubes, the ends of the latter terminating in cups
held by the statues. Water is poured into the pedestal through
a hole, which is stopped up immediately afterward.</p>

<p>If, then, a fire be kindled upon the altar, the air within expanding,
will penetrate the pedestal and force out the water;
but the latter, having no other outlet than the tubes, mounts
into the cups and the statues thus perform libations, which last
as long as the fire does. Upon the fire being extinguished, the
libations cease, and recommence as many times as it is rekindled.</p>

<p>The tube through which the heat is conveyed should be
larger at the middle than at the extremities, to allow the heat,
or more especially, the draft, which it produces, to accumulate
in an inflation, in order to be most effectual.</p>

<p>The priests of the temples of old were truly masters of the
arts of mechanics and pneumatics.</p>

<p>According to Father Kircher (<i>Oed. Aegypt.</i>, Vol. II), an
author, whom he calls Bitho, states that there was at Saïs a
temple of Minerva containing an altar upon which, when a fire
was kindled, Dionysos and Artemis (Bacchus and Diana) poured
out milk and wine, while a dragon hissed. The use of steam is
indicated here.</p>

<div class="dctr04"><img src="images/i010.png"

THE MIRACULOUS STATUE OF CYBELE.</div></div>

<p>The Jesuit savant possessed in his museum an apparatus
which probably came from some ancient Egyptian temple. It
consisted of a hollow hemispherical dome supported by four
columns, and placed over the image of the goddess of the numerous
breasts. To two of the columns were adjusted movable
holders, upon which lamps were fixed. The hemisphere was
hermetically closed beneath by a metallic plate. The small altar,
into which the milk was poured, communicated
with the interior <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
of the statue by a tube reaching nearly to the bottom; it was
also connected with the hollow dome by a tube having a double
bend. At the moment of sacrifice, the two lamps, which were
turned by means of movable holders directly beneath the lower
plate of the dome, were lighted, thereby causing the air inclosed
in the dome to expand. This expanded air, passing through
the tube, pressed upon the milk shut within the altar, forcing it
to ascend the straight tube into the interior of the statue and up
to the height of the breasts of the goddess. A series of little
ducts, branching off from the principal tube, conveyed the liquid
into the breasts. From these mammary glands
of bronze the <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
lacteal fluid streamed out, to the great admiration of the spectators,
who believed that a miracle had taken place. When the
sacrifice was finished, the lamps were extinguished by the attendant
priest of the shrine, and the milk ceased to flow.</p>

<p>There were many other mechanical devices of great interest,
such as the miraculous vessels used in the temples of Egypt and
Greece, and the apparatus that formed part of the Grecian
puppet-shows and other theatrical performances; but these hardly
come within the scope of this chapter. Philo of Byzantium and
Heron of Alexandria both left exhaustive treatises on the mechanic
arts as understood by the ancients. Philo’s work has
unfortunately been lost, but Heron’s treatise has a world of
interest to anyone who is attracted to the subject.</p>

<p>Besides the miracle-mongers of antiquity there were also
cup-and-ball conjurers, who were called “acetabularii,” from the
Latin word <i>acetabulum</i>, which means a cup, and professors of
natural magic in general who laid no claim to supernatural
powers. They wandered from place to place, giving their shows.
The grammarian, Athenæus, in his <i>Deipnosophists</i>, or “Banquet
of the Learned” (A. D. 228), mentions a number of famous
conjurers and jugglers of Greece. He says: “The people of
Histiæa and of Oreum erected in their theatre a brazen statue
holding a die in its hand to Theodorus the juggler.” Xenophon,
the conjurer, was very popular at Athens. He left behind him
a pupil named Cratisthenes, “a citizen of Phlias;
a man who <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
used to make fire spout up of its own accord, and who contrived
many other extraordinary sights, so as almost to make men
discredit the evidence of their own senses. And Nymphodorus,
the conjurer, was another such man. . . . And Diopeithes, the
Locrian, according to the account of Phanodemus, when he
came to Thebes, fastened round his waist bladders full of wine
and milk, and then, squeezing them, pretended that he was
drawing up those liquids out of his mouth. And Noëmon gained
a great reputation for the same sort of tricks. . . . There were
also, at Alexander’s court, the following jugglers who had a
great name: Scymnus of Tarentum, and Philistides of Syracuse,
and Heraclitus of Mitylene.” (<i>Deipn.</i> Epit., B. 1,
c. 34, 35.)</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">II.</h3>

<p>In the Middle Ages the art of magic was ardently
cultivated, in spite of the denunciations of the Church.
Many pretenders to necromancy made use of the secrets
of optics and acoustics, and gained thereby a wonderful
reputation as genuine sorcerers. Benvenuto Cellini,
sculptor, goldsmith and man-at-arms, in that greatest
of autobiographies,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5"
id="fnanc5">5</a> records a magical seance which reads
like a chapter from the Arabian Nights.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc5" id="fn5">5</a>
<i>Memoirs of Cellini</i>, Book I, Chapter LXIV.</p></div>

<p>He says: “It happened through a variety of singular accidents
that I became intimate with a Sicilian priest, who was a
man of very elevated genius and well instructed in both Latin
and Greek letters. In the course of conversation one day, we
were led to talk about the art of necromancy, <i>à propos</i> of which I
said: ‘Throughout my whole life I have had the most intense
desire to see or learn something of this art.’ Thereto the priest
replied: ‘A stout soul and a steadfast must the man have who
sets himself to such an enterprise.’ I answered that of strength
and steadfastness of soul I should have enough and to spare,
provided I found the opportunity. Then the priest said: ‘If
you have the heart to dare it, I will amply satisfy your curiosity.’
Accordingly we agreed upon attempting the adventure.</p>

<p>“The priest one evening made his preparations, and bade me
find a comrade, or not more than two. I invited Vincenzio
Romoli, a very dear friend of mine, and the priest took with him
a native of Pistoja, who also cultivated the black art. We went
together to the Colosseum; and there the priest, having arrayed
himself in necromancers’ robes, began to describe circles on the
earth with the finest ceremonies that can be imagined. I must
say that he had made us bring precious perfumes and fire, and
also drugs of fetid odor. When the preliminaries were completed,
he made the entrance into the circle; and taking us by the
hand, introduced us one by one inside of it. Then he assigned
our several functions; to the necromancer, his comrade, he gave
the pentacle to hold; the other two of us had to look after the
fire and the perfumes; and then he began his
incantations. This <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
lasted more than an hour and a half, when several legions
appeared and the Colosseum was all full of devils. I was occupied
with the precious perfumes, and when the priest perceived in
what numbers they were present, he turned to me and said:
‘Benvenuto, ask them something.’ I called on them to reunite
me with my Sicilian Angelica.”</p>

<p>It seems the spirits did not respond. The magic spells were
found inoperative, whereupon the priest dismissed the demons,
observing that the presence of a pure boy was requisite to the
successful accomplishment of the séance.</p>

<p>Another night Cellini and the sorcerer repaired to the ruins
of the Colosseum. The artist was accompanied by a boy of twelve
years of age, who was in his employ, and by two friends, Agnolino
Gaddi and the before-mentioned Romoli. The necromancer,
after describing the usual magic circle and building a fire, “began
to utter those awful invocations, calling by name on multitudes
of demons who are captains of their legions&#xa0;.&#xa0;.&#xa0;.&#xa0;; insomuch
that in a short space of time the whole Colosseum was full of a
hundredfold as many as had appeared upon the first occasion.”
At the advice of the wizard, Cellini again asked to be reunited
with his mistress. The sorcerer turned to him and said: “Hear
you what they have replied; that in the space of one month you
will be where she is.” The company within the magic circle
were now confronted by a great company of demons. The boy
declared that he saw four armed giants of immense stature who
were endeavoring to get within the circle. They trembled with
fear. The necromancer, to calm the fright of the boy, assured
him that what they beheld was but <i>smoke and shadows</i>, and that
the spirits were under his power. As the smoke died out, the
demons faded away, and Cellini and his friends left the place
fully satisfied of the reality of the conjurations. As they left
the Colosseum, the boy declared that he saw two of the demons
leaping and skipping before them, and often upon the roofs of
the houses. The priest paid no attention to them, but endeavored
to persuade the goldsmith to renew the attempt on some future
occasion, in order to discover the secret treasures of the earth.
But Cellini did not care to meddle more in
the black art. <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span></p>

<p>What are we to believe about this magic invocation? Was
Cellini romancing? Though a vainglorious, egotistical man, he
was truthful, and his memoirs may be relied on.</p>

<p>John Addington Symonds, one of the translators of Cellini’s
autobiography, remarks: “Imagination and the awe-inspiring
influences of the place, even if we eliminate a possible magic
lantern among the conjurer’s appurtenances, are enough to
account for what Cellini saw. He was credulous; he was super­sti­tious.”</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster, who quotes Cellini’s narrative in his
<i>Natural Magic</i>, explains that the demons seen in the Colosseum
“were not produced by any influence upon the imag­i­na­tions of
the spectators, but were actual optical phantasms, or the images
of pictures or objects produced by one or more concave mirrors
or lenses. A fire is lighted and perfumes and incense are burnt,
in order to create a ground for the images, and the beholders
are rigidly confined within the pale of the magic circle. The
concave mirror and the objects presented to it having been so
placed that the persons within the circle could not see the aerial
image of the objects by the rays directly reflected from the
mirror, the work of deception was ready to begin. The attendance
of the magician upon his mirror was by no means necessary.
He took his place along with the spectators within the
magic circle. The images of the devils were all distinctly formed
in the air immediately above the fire, but none of them could be
seen by those within the circle.</p>

<p>“The moment, however, the perfumes were thrown into the
fire to produce smoke, the first wreath of smoke that rose through
the place of one or more of the images would reflect them to the
eyes of the spectators, and they would again disappear if the
wreath was not followed by another. More and more images
would be rendered visible as new wreaths of smoke arose, and
the whole group would appear at once when the smoke was
uniformly diffused over the place occupied by the images.”</p>

<p>Again, the magician may have been aided by a confederate
amid the ruins, who manipulated a magic lantern, or some device
of the kind. The magician himself may have been provided with
a box fitted up with a concave mirror, the lights
and figures of <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
the demons. The assertion of the boy that he saw demons
skipping in front of him, etc., would be accounted for by the
magic box being carried with them.</p>

<p>Says the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, in speaking of Cellini’s
adventure: “The existence of a camera at this latter date (middle
of sixteenth century) is a fact, for the instrument is described by
Baptista Porta, the Neapolitan philosopher, in the <i>Magia Naturalis</i>
(1558). And the doubt how magic lantern effects could
have been produced in the fourteenth century, when the lantern
itself is alleged to have been invented by Athanasius Kircher
in the middle of the seventeenth century, is set at rest by the fact
that glass lenses were constructed at the earlier of these dates,—Roger
Bacon, in his <i>Discovery of the Miracles of Art, Nature
and Magic</i> (about 1260), writing of glass lenses and perspectives
so well made as to give good telescopic and microscopic effects,
and to be useful to old men and those who have weak eyes.”</p>

<p>Chaucer, in the <i>House of Fame</i>, Book III, speaks of “appearances
such as the subtil tregetours perform at feasts”—images
of hunting, falconry and knights jousting, with the persons and
objects instantaneously disappearing.</p>

<p>Later on Nostradamus conjured up a vision of the future
king of France in a magic mirror, for the benefit of Marie de
Medeci. This illusion was effected by mirrors adroitly concealed
amid hanging draperies.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century conjurers wandered from place to
place, exhibiting their tricks at fairs, in barns, and at the castles
of noblemen. They were little more than strolling gypsies or
vagabonds. Reginald Scott, in his <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>
(1584), enumerates some of the stock feats of these mountebanks.
The list includes, “swallowing a knife; burning a card
and reproducing it from the pocket of a spectator; passing a
coin from one pocket to another; converting money into counters,
or counters into money; conveying money into the hand of
another person; making a coin pass through a table or vanish
from a handkerchief; tying a knot and undoing it ‘by the power
of words’; taking beads from a string, the ends of which are
held fast by another person; making a coin to pass from one
box to another; turning wheat into flour ‘by
the power of <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
words’; burning a thread and making it whole again; pulling
ribbons from the mouth; thrusting a knife into the head of a
man; putting a ring through the cheek, and cutting off a person’s
head and restoring it to its former position.”</p>

<p>Conjuring with cups and balls belongs to this list.</p>

<p>The conjurer of the sixteenth century, and even of later date,
wore about his waist a sort of bag, called <i>gibécière</i>, from its
resemblance to a game bag, ostensibly to hold his paraphernalia.
While delving into this bag for various articles to be
used in his tricks, the magician succeeded in making substitutions
and secretly getting possession of eggs, coins, balls, etc.
It was a very clumsy device, but indispensable
for an open-air <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
performer, who usually stood encircled by the spectators.
Finally, the suspicious-looking <i>gibécière</i> was abandoned by all
save strolling mountebanks, and a table with a long cloth substituted.
This table concealed an assistant, who made the necessary
transformations required in the act, by means of traps
and other devices. Comus, the elder, in the eighteenth century,
abandoned the long table covers and the concealed assistant for
the <i>servante</i>. But his immediate competitors still adhered to
the draped tables, and a whole generation of later conjurers,
among whom may be mentioned Comte, Bosco and Phillippe,
followed their example. Robert-Houdin struck the keynote of
reform in 1844. He sarcastically called the suspiciously draped
table a <i>boite à compère</i> (wooden confederate).</p>

<p>Conjurers in the seventeenth century were frequently known
as <i>Hocus Pocus</i>. These curious words first occur in a pamphlet
printed in 1641, in which the author, speaking of the sights of
Bartholomew fair, mentions “<i>Hocus Pocus</i>, with three yards of
tape or ribbon in his hand, showing his art of legerdemain.”
The seventeenth century is the age of the strolling mountebank,
who performed wherever he could get an audience—in the stable,
barnyard, street or fair. From him to the pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur of
the theatre is a long step, but no longer than from the barnstorming
actor to the artist of the well-appointed playhouse.
There is evolution in everything. It was not until the eighteenth
century that conjuring became a legitimate profession. This
was largely owing to the fact that men of gentle birth, well
versed in the science of the age, took up the magic wand, and
gave the art dignity and respectability.</p>

<p>It was not until the eighteenth century that natural magic
was shorn of charlatanism, but even then the great Pinetti pretended
to the occult in his exhibition of so-called “second sight.”
He always avoided the Papal States, taking warning from the
fate of Cagliostro. Magic and spiritism were in bad odor in
the dominions of the Pope. Towards the middle of the century
we hear of Jonas, Carlotti, Katerfelto, Androletti, Philadelphia,
Rollin, Comus I and II. Comus II was famous for coining hard
words. He advertised in London, “various uncommon experiments
with his Enchanted
Horologium, Pyxidees Literarum, <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
and many curious operations in Rhabdology, Steganography and
Phylacteria, with many wonderful performances on the grand
Dodecahedron, also Chartomantic Deceptions and Kharamatic
Operations. To conclude with the performance of the Teretopaest
Figure and Magical House; the like never seen in this
kingdom before; and will astonish every beholder.” These magical
experiments were doubtless very simple. What puzzled the
spectators must have been the names of the tricks.</p>

<p>Rollin, a Frenchman, after accumulating a fortune, purchased
the chateau of Fontenoy-aux-Roses, in the department of
the Seine. He was denounced under the Red Terror, and suffered
death by the guillotine, in 1793. When the warrant for
his execution was read to him, he remarked, with a smile, “That
is the first paper I cannot conjure away.”</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>I now come to the Count Edmond de Grisy, Pinetti’s great
rival in the field of conjuring.</p>

<p>The duel for supremacy between these eminent magicians
is told in the chapter on Pinetti. The father of De Grisy, the
Count de Grisy, was killed at the storming of the Tuilleries,
while defending the person of his king, Louis XVI, from the
mob. Young De Grisy was in Paris at the time, and, profiting
by the disorders in the capital, was enabled to pass the barriers
and reach the small family domain in Languedoc. Here he dug
up a hundred louis, which his father had concealed for any unforseen
accident; to this money he added some jewels left by his
mother. With this modest sum, he proceeded to Florence, where
he studied medicine, graduating as a physician at the age of
twenty-seven. He became a professional magician, and had an
adventure at Rome which is well worth relating. He was requested
to perform before Pius VII, and ransacked his brains
to devise a trick worthy of a Pope. On the day before the mystic
séance he happened to be in the shop of a prominent watchmaker,
when a lackey came in to ask if His Eminence the Cardinal de
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
 src="images/dash-2em.png" width="141"
 height="60" alt="——" />’s</span>
watch was repaired. <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span></p>

<p>“It will not be ready until this evening,” answered the watchmaker.
“I will do myself the honor of personally carrying it
to your master.”</p>

<p>The lackey retired.</p>

<p>“That is a handsome watch you have there,” said De Grisy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the jeweler, “it is valued at more than ten
thousand francs. It was made by the celebrated Bréguet.
Strangely enough, the other day I was offered a similar timepiece,
by the same artist, for one thousand francs.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?” asked the Count.</p>

<p>“A young prodigal and gambler, belonging to a noble family,
who is now reduced to selling his family jewels.”</p>

<p>Like a flash of lightning, a scheme for working a splendid
mystification passed through De Grisy’s mind. He nonchalantly
said:</p>

<p>“Where is this young rake to be found?”</p>

<p>“In a gaming house, which he never quits.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I will buy this masterpiece of Bréguet’s. Have
the kindness to purchase it for me, and engrave upon it the
Cardinal’s coat-of-arms, so that it will be a replica of His Eminence’s
chronometer.”</p>

<p>The jeweler, assured of De Grisy’s discretion and honor,
though probably suspecting the use to which the timepiece would
be subjected, immediately left his shop, and returned after a
little while with the gambler’s watch.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” he cried. “To-night I shall have it ready for
you.”</p>

<p>At the appointed hour he brought the two watches for De
Grisy’s inspection. They were facsimiles. The conjurer took
his purchase, and the next day appeared at the pontifical palace,
where a most distinguished audience greeted him. The Pope
sat on a raised dais; near him were the cardinals in their brilliant
robes of crimson.</p>

<p>After performing a series of magical feats, De Grisy came to
his <i>pièce de résistance</i>. The difficulty was to obtain the loan of
the Cardinal’s watch, and that without asking him directly for
it. To succeed the conjurer had recourse to a
ruse. At his <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
request several watches were offered to him, but he returned
them as not suited to the experiment.</p>

<p>“I desire a timepiece that will be easily identified. I should
prefer one of rather large size,” said De Grisy.</p>

<p>“Cardinal,” said His Holiness, “oblige me by lending your
watch to M. de Grisy.”</p>

<p>With great reluctance the Cardinal de <img class="iglyph-a"
 src="images/dash-2em.png" width="141"
 height="60" alt="——" /> handed his
precious chronometer to the conjurer. It seems he set great
value on its exaggerated size, alleging, with considerable show
of reason, that the works acted better in a large case.</p>

<p>In order to prove the solidity and excellence of the chronometer,
De Grisy let it fall to the ground. A cry of alarm arose
on all sides. The Cardinal, pale with rage, bounded from his
chair, exclaiming: “This is a sorry jest, sir!”</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed, monsignor,” said De Grisy, “the watch
will escape scathless from its many trials.” He handed the
broken timepiece to the Cardinal. “Do you recognize this as
your watch?”</p>

<p>The prelate gazed anxiously at the coat-of-arms engraved
inside of the case, and replied, with a profound sigh:</p>

<p>“Yes, that is my watch.”</p>

<p>“You are certain of it?”</p>

<p>“Quite certain! But I seriously doubt your power to restore
it.”</p>

<p>“We shall see!” said the conjurer.</p>

<p>De Grisy’s assistant now brought in a brass mortar and
pestle. The watch was cast into the mortar and pounded to
atoms. Some magic powder was poured into the receptacle and
a torch applied. There was a detonation, followed by a cloud
of smoke. The spectators were invited to examine the ingot of
gold—all that remained of the precious chronometer. Pius VII
peered curiously into the mortar. De Grisy, seizing the opportunity,
adroitly popped the duplicate timepiece into a pocket of
the Pope’s robe. At the proper moment he pretended to pass
the ingot into the pontiff’s pocket, which resulted in the discovery
of the Cardinal’s watch, made whole again. This clever trick
created a great sensation in Rome, and drew crowds to De
Grisy’s performances. Poor De Grisy
seemed doomed to <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
misfortune. His young son was killed accidentally by a spectator,
during an exhibition of the pistol trick at Strasburg. A real
bullet got mixed up with the false bullets, and was loaded into
the weapon. De Grisy was tried and convicted of “homicide
through imprudence,” and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment,
during which time his wife died. On his release, he
assumed the name of Torrini, which was that of his brother-in-law
and faithful assistant. He retired to the provinces of France,
and never appeared again in the large cities. He died a brokenhearted
man at Lyons.</p>

<p>Torrini was a skillful performer with cards, as Robert-Houdin
testifies. He invented a trick which he called “The
Blind Man’s Game of Piquet.” While blindfolded he would
play piquet and defeat adepts at the game. This trick was one
of the features of his entertainments, and always gained him
great applause. The secret consisted in substituting a prepared
pack for the ordinary pack used. After the spectator had
shuffled the cards and handed them to Torrini to cut, the conjurer
would rest his hand momentarily upon the pack, while he
made some observation to his opponent. Then it was that the
substitution was artfully effected by means of a “magic box,”
which the pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur had concealed in the sleeve of his coat.
Pressure upon the table caused a spring in the box to shoot
out a prepared pack of cards, while a pair of pincers at the same
time seized the recently shuffled pack and drew it up into the
hidden receptacle. This ingenious piece of apparatus Torrini
had obtained from a gambler named Zilbermann.</p>

<p>While attempting to cheat an opponent, the apparatus had
hung fire, and Zilbermann was detected <i>in flagrante delicto</i>. A
duel was the result, and Zilbermann was mortally wounded.
He sent for Torrini, whose conjuring abilities he greatly admired,
and presented him with the box. Soon afterwards he
died.</p>

<p>Torrini never used the apparatus except in his conjuring
performances. He was a man of honor and not a <i>chevalier
d’industrie</i>.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Paris! Time—the latter half of the eighteenth century!</p>

<p>Louis XVI is on the throne of France, relieving the ennui of
court etiquette by working at locksmithing. His beautiful consort,
Marie Antoinette, amuses herself playing at dairy-farming,
<img class="iglyph-a"

<i>la</i> Watteau, in the gardens of the little Trianon. Dr. Guillotin,
as yet, has not even dreamed of that terrible machine of wood
and steel to be called by his name. Danton, Marat and Robespierre—the
“bloody triumvirate”—are unknown to fame.</p>

<p>It is the age of powder and patches, enormous hoop-skirts,
embroidered coats, lace ruffles, cocked hats, silk stockings and
swords. Gentlemen meet and exchange snuff boxes; fight duels
at times, despite the royal edict; indulge in grandiose gallantries.
Noblemen in their coaches-and-four, on their way to
Versailles (which to them is heaven on earth), drive recklessly
through the narrow streets of the capital, splashing the pedestrians
with mud from the kennels, and knocking down citizens
with impunity. The aristocracy live to be amused.</p>

<p><i>Vive la bagatelle!</i> is the watchword of the gentle born, and
when the Chevalier Pinetti, knight of the German Order of
Merit of St. Philippe, comes to town, there is a grand rush for
seats at the theatre to see him perform. The Chevalier is the
greatest conjurer of the age, also a learned student of physics
and member of various scientific bodies in France, England and
Germany. <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span></p>

<p>I have in my possession an old print, picked up in Paris, a
portrait of the Chevalier. This picture is an allegorical affair.
Two winged cupids are depicted placing the bust of Pinetti in
the Temple of Arts. Strewn about the place are various instruments
used in physics and mathematics. The motto appended
to this curious print is as follows: <i>Des genies placent le buste de
M. le Professeur Pinetti dans le temple des arts, au milieu des
instruments de physique et de mathematique</i>.

<p>At Versailles the Chevalier is received with acclaim. His
“shirt trick” produces a great sensation. Imagine whisking the
shirt off a gentleman’s back without disturbing the rest of his
clothing. But of that, anon! The “second-sight” of the Chevalier’s
spouse savors of the supernatural; and his “ring and fish”
feat is just too wonderful for anything. In short, the conjurer
is voted to be very amusing; therefore, he should be patronized.</p>

<p>Pinetti was the prince of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teurs of the eighteenth
century. His life reads like a romance. After a brilliant, pyrotechnic
career, he faded out into darkness. I have gathered
my facts concerning him from old French and German brochures.
Little or nothing is known about his ancestry, his youth and early
experiences.</p>

<p>He may have purposely guarded the secret of his origin,
being inordinately boastful. He thoroughly understood how to
avail himself of all the arts of the toilet to appear much younger
than, according to his contemporaries, he must have been in
reality.</p>

<p>It is believed that he first saw the light of day in 1750, in
Orbitello, a small fortified town of about three thousand inhabitants,
lying in the foothills of what was then the Grand Duchy
of Tuscany.</p>

<p>He is first heard of while traveling through the provinces of
Germany, in 1783. In 1784 he appeared in Paris, where he
gave a series of performances, and exhibited several times before
the court of Louis XVI with distinguished success. At this
time the public showed a marked predilection for all kinds of
mystical and inexplicable exhibitions, which had been awakened
by the performances of various adventurers, like Cagliostro, St.
Germain and Mesmer. Pinetti thoroughly understood how to
make the most of this bent of the public mind, and succeeded
in setting Paris in ecstasy, as well as becoming himself a model
for all contemporary and succeeding necromancers, for a long
time. Though without fine or regular features, his physiognomy
possessed much distinction; while his manners were excellent.
It is probable, however, that the latter were acquired rather than
innate; for extremely bad taste is betrayed by his frequently
wearing on the stage the uniform of a
general, decorated with <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
numerous orders. This is an oddity with a fatal suggestion of
charlatanism. He was given to vaunting, and was in no wise
careful to adhere to the truth in com­mu­ni­ca­tions regarding his
magical art. A vicious trait of his character was his readiness
to adopt the most contemptible measures to free himself of the
rivalry of another; and this unworthy characteristic undoubtedly
led to his ultimate downfall.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">II.</h3>

<p>Pinetti’s repertory was very extended. However interesting
it might be to pass in review the whole series of his feats, I must
here limit myself to a few, which appear typical of him and of
his public.</p>

<p>There was first the wonderful automaton known as “The
Grand Sultan,” also called “The clever little Turk,” which was
about forty centimeters in height, and which struck a bell with
a hammer, or nodded and shook his head, in answer to questions
propounded. “The golden head and the rings” was as follows:
In a glass, the bottom of which was covered with coins, a previously
shown, massive head was placed. A cover was then
placed on the glass. The head answered yes or no to inquiries,
or counted numbers by leaping in the glass. In a second glass
borrowed rings were laid, which moved in unison with the head,
as though by sympathy. The “Clever Swan” was put into
a vessel of water, and varied its course according to the will
of the onlooker. Moreover, when a spectator had drawn a
card from a pack of inscribed cards, it spelled the word written
thereon, by moving toward the appropriate letters, which were
printed on strips of cardboard hung about the vessel.</p>

<p>A kind of sympathetic action is shown in the following
experiment. A lighted lamp was deposited on a table. As soon
as a spectator, stationed at a considerable distance, blew through
a reed, the lamp was immediately extinguished. Another: a
live dove was fastened, by means of two ribbons about its neck,
to two opposite columns. On the instant when a picture of the
dove, or even the shadow of the suspended bird, was pierced by
a sword, the dove itself was beheaded, although it had not been
disturbed, and the severed and still bleeding head,
and the rest <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
of the body, fell separately to the ground. This experiment,
called “Theophrastus Paracelsus,” recalls an old super­sti­tion,
namely, that evil can be wrought upon a person by injury to a
picture of him, accompanied by a spoken incantation. It is
the so-called “Picture charm.”</p>

<p>Fettering and binding experiments were shown, but of a
simpler nature than modern ones. To each leg of the magician
was fastened a ring, and through each ring an iron chain was
passed, its ends locked on a pillar. “The Prisoner” seemed aided
by some external power to release himself, for in a very short
time he was free from his bonds. More difficult was another
experiment, wherein a chain was fastened by a strip of cloth
directly about the leg, and secured to the pillar; but here also, a
half minute sufficed the “Galley Slave” to free himself of the
shackles. The most pleasing was the following trick: Pinetti
allowed both thumbs to be tied together with a cord, and his
hands, so bound, to be covered with a hat; hardly was this done
than he stretched out his right hand, seized a flask of wine and
drank to the health of the person who had tied him, and tossed
the emptied glass to the ceiling, whence it fell as a ball of finely-cut
paper. At the same instant, he allowed the hat to fall, and
displayed his hands, still as closely bound as at the beginning of
the experiment.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanc6">6</a>
Also, the well-known trick, in which several
borrowed rings are passed over two ribbon bands, the ends
of which are knotted together and held by some of the spectators;
nevertheless the rings can be drawn off without severing
the ribbons. This was hardly new, but merely a variation of a
trick described in 1690, in a work by Ozanam, in his <i>Récréations
Mathematiques</i>, and exhibited by the jugglers of that time under
the name of “My Grandmother’s Rose Wreath.” They made
use of small balls, strung on two cords, from which they were
withdrawn, notwithstanding that the cords were held by strangers.
To-day this trick is explained in most books of games and
amusements, which fact does not hinder the public from being
quite as much astounded when the feat is performed

There is nothing new under the sun. A Japanese
conjurer, named Ten-Ichi, at the present writing, is creating a
sensation in our vaudeville theatres with this same thumb-tying
trick.</p></div>

<p>Pinetti’s magical bouquet was a very pretty trick. In a vase
were placed the dry, leafless stems of a bunch of flowers, tied
together. At the magician’s command, leaves, flowers and fruit
appeared, transforming the bouquet into a thing of beauty; but
all its splendor disappeared again at the command of the performer.
His feat of the “recovered ring” was as follows: A
ring was borrowed from a lady and fired from a pistol into
a casket, which had been previously shown empty and devoid of
preparation. When the casket was opened, after the shot was
fired, a dove was seen within, holding in its bill the ring. But,
in addition, the pretty bird knew precisely the possessor of the
ring, for it shook its head in rotation at each lady to whom the
trinket did not belong. When the owner
appeared, the dove <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
voluntarily presented the ring to her in its beak. In Naples,
where Pinetti’s theatre was situated directly on the sea shore, he
varied the trick by firing the pistol loaded with the ring out of
the window. On opening the casket a large fish was seen, bearing
the ring in its mouth.</p>

<p>Another clever experiment was the mechanical bird, which,
when set upon a flask, fluttered its wings and whistled any
favorite melody called for by the audience, also blowing out a
lighted candle and immediately relighting it. It would accomplish
these feats just as well when removed from the flask to a
table, or when held in the performer’s hand upon any part of the
stage. The sounds were produced by a “confederate who imitated
song birds after Rossignol’s method, by aid of the inner
skin of an onion in the mouth, and speaking trumpets directed
the sounds to whatever position was occupied by the bird.”
Though the two last described feats were the most celebrated of
Pinetti’s masterpieces, the most remarkable, without doubt, was
the one he called “The stolen shirt.” In spite of its somewhat
unseemly appearance, it was shown before the king and his
family, and consisted of this: A gentleman from the audience,
not in league with the performer, came upon the stage and, at
Pinetti’s request, unfastened the buttons of his shirt at the neck
and cuffs, and Pinetti, with only a few movements of his hand
drew the shirt from his body, though the gentleman had not
removed a single article of his clothing.</p>

<p>Pinetti eventually revealed the process by which this surprising
result was obtained. He was moved to do so, because
all those who saw the trick performed in the Theatre des Menus-Plaisirs
held the conviction that the other party to it was in
collusion with him. The public was not to be blamed for this
erroneous conclusion, for not only at that time, but much later,
many of the astonishing feats of the magician were effected
through the complicity of assistants seated among the audience.
Such confederates were called by the French, <i>Compères</i> and <i>Commères</i>,
which translated into the vulgar vernacular, stand for
“pals,” “cronies.” These gentlemen brought articles, of which
the magician possessed duplicates, and loaned them—apparently
as unrelated spectators—when such articles were
asked for in <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
the course of the experiments. Robert-Houdin ended this régime
of confederacy. When he asked for the loan of an article, he
genuinely borrowed it, and exchanged it for a substitute by
sleight of hand. This is the modern method. The following is
Pinetti’s explanation of the shirt trick: “The means of performing
this trick are the following—only observing that the clothes
of the person whose shirt is to be pulled off be wide and easy:
Begin by making him pull off his stock
and unbuttonning his <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
shirt at the neck and sleeves, afterwards tie a little string in the
buttonhole of the left sleeve; then, passing your hand behind his
back, pull the shirt out of his breeches and slip it over his head;
then, pulling it out before in the same manner, you will leave it
on his stomach; after that, go to the right hand and pull the
sleeve down, so as to have it all out of the arm; the shirt being
then all of a heap, as well in the right sleeve as before the
stomach, you are to make use of this little string fastened to the
buttonhole of the left sleeve to get back the sleeve that must
have slipt up, and to pull the whole shirt out that way. To hide
your way of operating from the person whom you unshift, and
from the assembly, you may cover his head with a lady’s cloak,
holding a corner of it in your teeth. In order to be more at
your ease, you may mount on a chair and do the whole operation
under the cloak.”</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>Pinetti’s explanation of the shirt trick was contained in a
work entitled <i>Amusements Physiques, Paris, 1784</i>. An edition
in English of this book was published in London in the same
year. It was called: “Amusements in physics, and various entertaining
experiments, invented and executed at Paris and the
various courts of Europe by the Chevalier M. Jean-Joseph
Pinetti Willedale de Merci, Knight of the German Order of
Merit of St. Philip, professor of mathematics and natural philosophy,
pensioned by the Court of Prussia, patronized by all the
Royal Family of France, aggregate of the Royal Academy of
Sciences and Belle-Lettres of Bordeaux, etc.” As an exposé of
conjuring feats in general this work was an imposition on the
public. It was intended to mislead the reader. In spite of the
high-sounding title of the work, it contained nothing outside of
the solution of the “stolen shirt” mystery. There was no explanation
of any trick upon which Pinetti set value, but merely
experiments already published in preceding books on the juggler’s
art, and which belonged to a long-past time, consisting
mostly of chemical experiments
and childish diversions. <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span></p>

<p>This unworthy publication, and Pinetti’s custom of speaking
of himself as endowed with preternatural powers, aroused an
adversary in the person of M. Henri Decremps, of the Museum
of Paris, an accomplished and enthusiastic lover of the art of
magic. From him appeared a book entitled, <i>La Magie blanche
dévoilée</i>, Paris, 1784, addressed, as he declares in the preface,
not to the great public, since “the world loves to be deceived,
and would rather believe the fairy tales of the imposter than the
unvarnished truth of his opponent,” but to the real lovers of an
entertaining art. As this work set forth the real explanation of
Pinetti’s wonders, one may imagine what reception it met with
from him and his admiring public. Characteristic of Pinetti is
the manner in which he sought revenge on Decremps. In one
of his performances he deplored the fact that an ignorant imposter,
solely with the intent of injuring him (Pinetti), sought
to reveal mysteries which his intelligence was insufficient to
grasp. All knew to whom he referred, who had the slightest
knowledge of Decremps. And what now ensued? Hardly had
Pinetti finished speaking, when a shabbily-dressed and unprepossessing
individual arose, assailed Pinetti with abuse and bade
him take care, he would be fully exposed. The audience, indignant
at the disturbance of an amusing performance, jeered the
man from whom it proceeded, and made preparation to expel the
poor devil. Here intervened, however, the “good” Pinetti. In
conciliatory, kindly fashion, he accompanied his assailant to the
door, ostentatiously presenting him also with several louis d’or
as indemnification for the harshness shown him.</p>

<p>Needless to explain, the expelled intruder was not the author
of the book in question, but genuinely a “poor devil” who played
his part in the comedy, for a money consideration. However,
Decremps was an able man, who could act with as much shrewdness
as energy. In 1785 he followed his first book with a second,
explaining Pinetti’s newest tricks, the self-playing organ,
artificial snakes and birds, chess-playing automatons, ascending
balloons in human shape, perpetual motion, learned animals,
automatic flute playing, etc. The handling of the topic is much
more thorough than in the first volume, and the matter interestingly
set forth. It is in the form of letters of
travel; the author
<span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
in company with a Mr. Hill, an Englishman, traverses distant
lands, where remarkable and astonishing things are met with,
and the causes and construction which bring about their wonderful
results, are ascertained and explained.</p>

<p>They reach the Cape of Good Hope, where, amid a savage
population, with many arts of refined civilization, they encounter
a wizard, who, in a bombastic declaration, extols his own wonder-working
powers. In the course of the narrative these feats
are described and their operation explained. The behavior of
the wizard is amusingly depicted. How strenuously he denies
the truth of the solution of his wonders found by the strangers;
how he endeavors, by means of every artifice, to hoodwink the
public; how he first strives, through cunning and bribery, then
through abuse and injury, to rid himself of his dangerous adversaries—in
all this is Pinetti’s character so intimately pictured
that we cannot err in supposing this entire portion of the book
directed solely against him. And what name does he give the
wizard? He calls him “Pilferer.” Decidedly, Decremps could
be severe.</p>

<p>These books were translated into English in 1785, and published
as a single volume, under the title of <i>The Conjurer Unmasked</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>Pinetti, who was an original genius, sought to overcome the
effects of Decremps’ revelations in other ways besides chicanery.
He invented new illusions, performed his old tricks with greater
dash and brilliancy, and added new appointments to his <i>mise en
scène</i>, to dazzle and overcome the spectators. His patter was
unceasing and convincing. But now was heard the distant
thunder of the approaching social upheaval—the French Revolution.
The political horizon was full of black clouds. The
people of Paris began to desert the theatres for clubs and cafés,
there to enter upon political discussions. Pinetti, seeing the
audiences of his Temple of Magic dwindling away, packed up
his apparatus and went to England, which is the immediate aim
of all fugitives from France.</p>

<p>During his stay in London he made the following announcement
in the newspapers: “The Chevalier Pinetti and his consort
will exhibit most wonderful,
stupendous and absolutely <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
inimitable, mechanical, physical and philosophical pieces, which his
recent deep scrutiny in these sciences, and assiduous exertion,
have enabled him to invent and construct; among which Chevalier
Pinetti will have the special honor and satisfaction of
exhibiting various experiments, of new discovery, no less curious
than seemingly incredulous, particularly that of Mme. Pinetti
being seated in one of the front boxes with a handkerchief over
her eyes and guessing at everything imagined and proposed to
her by any person in the company.” Here we have the first
mention of the “Second-Sight” trick, which Robert-Houdin re-invented
sixty-one years later, and which Robert Heller, not
many years ago, by using electricity combined with verbal signals,
made into such an astonishing feat of magic. The teachings
of Mesmer and the so-called sorcery of Cagliostro, evidently
suggested the idea of this pretended clairvoyance to Pinetti.
Truly was the Chevalier an original and creative genius. His
repertoire consisted almost entirely of his own inventions, and
eclipsed those of contemporary conjurers. His rope-tying experiments
were the prototypes for the cabinet evolutions of modern
mediums.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>Late in the year 1769, Pinetti appeared in Hamburg and
exhibited with great success in the “Drillhause,” where Degabriel
and Philadelphia had played previously. From there he went
to the principal cities of Germany and arrived at Berlin, where,
in the then “Doebbelin’schen Theatre,” in the Behrenstrasse, he
produced his “Amusements Physiques,” and soon became the
avowed idol of the public.</p>

<p>In August, 1796, he appeared in Hamburg, at the French
Theatre, on the Drehbahn, where his receipts were considerable.
Such was not the case, however, in Altona, whose inhabitants
were distinguished by lack of interest in any manifestation of his
art. He gave there three exhibitions, which terminated with
two empty houses. In Bremen, whither he next turned, the
public was even more indifferent than in Altona, so that he abandoned
the intention of performing there, returned to Berlin and
there remained

<p>Pinetti derived large profits from his entertainments. His
entrance fee was by no means low. In Hamburg and Berlin, for
instance, the price of the best places was a thaler—equivalent at
present values to about ten marks, $2.50. Pinetti saw carefully
to the comfort and pleasure of his patrons, and heightened the
effect of his skill by every available means. The eye was gratified
by the splendor of the scenic accessories. In the middle of
the stage, upon a superb carpet, stood two massive tables, which
served in performance of the experiments. They were covered
with scarlet cloths, bordered with broad stripes of dark velvet,
richly embroidered in gold and silver. Further in the background
stood a larger and a smaller table, with the same decorations,
and with relatively slender and elaborately carved legs.
Close to the rear of the stage, with a cover extending to the
carpet, was a very long table which was set forth with magnificent
candelabra and brilliant apparatus. The above-mentioned
tables were not moved from their places. In the middle of the
stage, hung from the ceiling an immense chandelier of crystal,
with countless candles. The artist made his entrance and exit
through silken hangings.</p>

<p>As in Paris, so also in Berlin, Pinetti found an adversary,
in the person of Kosmann, professor of physics, who in daily and
periodical publications sought to explain Pinetti’s experiments.
These elucidations were collected, bound together and published
in Berlin in the year 1797. The English translation of the title
is as follows: <i>Chevalier Pinetti’s Recreations in Physics, or
Explanation of His Tricks</i>. As with Decremps, so fared it with
Kosmann. His explanations did not meet with public accord,
and the contemporary press denominated the two authors “who
sought to belittle Pinetti’s skill,” as mere apprentices compared
with the latter, and their expositions “shallow and unsatisfactory.”
Naturally! The laity invariably form a false conception
of the nature of the art of magic. They suppose the most
complicated mechanism in the apparatus which the artist uses,
and overestimate the manual skill of the performer; and when
their ability is insufficient to explain matters after their own
fashion, they prefer to endow the performer with preternatural
power rather than accept the
“shallow” elucidations of <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
“ignorant” expounders. They do not realize that every trick is only
what the artist is able to make it, and that the simplest illusion
may take an imposing aspect through the accessories thrown
about it and the manner in which it is presented.</p>

<p>Whatever opinion the laity might have of these works, their
value was in no wise lessened for the instructed. Robert-Houdin,
an incontestable connoisseur, as well as a “classical” witness,
calls the work of M. Decremps, <i>White Magic Unveiled</i>—the
first edition of which could not have been unknown to the Berlin
professor—“an excellent work.”</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">V.</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the carnival of 1798, Pinetti appeared
in Naples, and saw the whole city crowding to his performances.</p>

<p>Among the constant visitors to his theatre (on the strand)
was numbered a young French nobleman, Count de Grisy, who
had settled in Naples as a physician, and was a welcome guest
in the most distinguished circles of the town. A passionate lover
of the art of magic, he succeeded in finding the key to a large
portion of Pinetti’s experiments, and amused himself in the
closest circles of his intimates, by repeating them. His ability
became generally known, and gained for him a kind of celebrity;
he was invited to perform in the most aristocratic salons, but
through modesty seldom accepted.</p>

<p>Finally his fame came to the ears of Pinetti, who was so
much the more chagrined because of the fact that people of
fashion, who had at first thronged his theatre, now were deserting
him. Nevertheless, he listened with apparent pleasure to the
reports given him of De Grisy’s skill, and sought to gain the
acquaintance of the young physician. He frankly proffered his
friendship, initiated De Grisy into his mysteries, and showed him
the arrangement of his stage. The familiarity which Pinetti
openly and intentionally displayed towards him might have displeased
the young man under other circumstances, but his passion
for magic and the persuasive eloquence which Pinetti employed
to arouse his ambition, made him blind
to conduct, which, <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
in the mind of one more versed in men, might have awakened
suspicion.</p>

<p>So Pinetti succeeded, finally, in overcoming De Grisy’s timidity
in regard to a public appearance. He repeated the most
flattering assurances of the latter’s skill, and urged him to give
a performance for the benefit of the poor of Naples. He would,
declared Pinetti, attract a more distinguished audience than he
himself could hope to do; and so, De Grisy, who had already
earned the gratitude of the poor, would become their greatest
benefactor in all the city. Pinetti would himself make all previous
arrangements most carefully, and would, moreover, hold
himself in readiness, behind the scenes, to come to the young
performer’s assistance, if required. De Grisy at last gave reluctant
consent. Fortune seemed to favor him, moreover, for the
King signified his intention to attend in company with his entire
court.</p>

<p>August 20, 1798, this extraordinary exhibition took place.
The house was packed. The royal family received the young
French emigrant with tokens of favor and sympathy. De Grisy,
confident of success, was in the happiest mood, but in his very
first experiment a bitter disillusion awaited him. A secret confederate,
posted by Pinetti, had loaned a ring to carry out the
already-described trick, “The Recovered Ring,” which was properly
found in the mouth of the great fish. Conscious of the
success of this loudly-applauded feat, De Grisy bowed his thanks,
when an angry remonstrance was heard from the person who
had loaned the ring. This man declared that in lieu of his costly
gold ring, set with diamonds, there had been returned to him a
trumpery imitation set with ordinary glass stones. A long and
painful discussion ensued, and De Grisy owed it only to his tact
that he finally extricated himself from the affair. He was not
clear himself as to whether the ring had somehow been changed,
or whether the assistant played a role from some secret motive.</p>

<p>He proceeded to the performance of his next experiment
with less concern, in that no secret confederate was needed. He
approached the King’s box and asked him to do him the honor
of drawing a card from a pack he tendered. The King complied
with much graciousness; but scarcely had he looked
at it than <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
he flung it to the ground with every mark of his displeasure.
De Grisy, confounded, picked up the card, and read on it a scandalous
insult to the king, in Pinetti’s handwriting! An attempt
to explain and clear himself was checked by an imperative gesture
from the King. The betrayed man, who now understood
the situation, distracted with rage, rushed behind the scenes with
the intent to kill his deceitful friend. Like a maniac he traversed
every portion of the house, but the Chevalier Pinetti had disappeared,
as though the earth had swallowed him! Wherever
De Grisy now showed himself, he was received with jeers, hisses
and insults from his audience, until he fell senseless and was
borne by servants to his house. After his rival’s removal, Pinetti
appeared as though by chance; whereupon several persons
in the secret called on him to continue the performance, to which
he courteously acceded, and gained enthusiastic plaudits.</p>

<p>During a violent fever which ensued, De Grisy constantly
called in his delirium for revenge on Pinetti; but the latter
quitted Naples soon after the occurrence. Poor De Grisy was
socially and professionally tabooed by the aristocracy of Naples.
Pinetti’s revenge seemed complete.</p>

<p>Though De Grisy thoroughly comprehended the contemptible
ruse of his opponent, he was long in uncertainty how to
punish him. His first impulse was to challenge the magician
to fight a duel, but that idea he rejected. Pinetti was not worthy
of such an honor. For the purpose of completing his restoration
to health, De Grisy passed some time in the quiet of the country,
and here the thought occurred to him to fight his betrayer with
his own weapons, and, in this contest, to either conquer or
wholly abandon all ideas of revenge. He set himself for half a
year to the most assiduous study, in order to attain perfection
in the art of magic, not merely equal to Pinetti’s, but superior
to it. He improved on many of his rival’s experiments, invented
new ones, and expended his entire fortune in providing apparatus
and decorations which should cast into the shade Pinetti’s
superb appointments.</p>

<p>And now issued De Grisy forth to a duel, bloodless, it is
true, but none the less a struggle
to the death. <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span></p>

<p>He learned that Pinetti had, in the meantime, visited the
principal cities of central Italy, and had just left Lucca with the
view of visiting Bologna next; later Modena, Parma, Piacenza,
etc. Without loss of time, De Grisy took his way to Modena, in
order to forestall his rival there, and debar him from any further
performances. The latter had already caused the announcement
of his forthcoming entertainments to be spread over the city,
and the Modena journals had widely advertised the speedy
coming of the wonder worker, when suddenly the exhibitions of
the “Count de Grisy, the French escamoteur,” were announced.
The people crowded the house from top to bottom. De Grisy’s
success was unparalleled. Then, as the date for Pinetti’s appearance
drew near, he left the town and went to Parma. Pinetti
had no faith in De Grisy’s success, and installed himself in the
same theatre which the latter had lately quitted, in reliance on
his own celebrity. But here began that humiliating experience
which was henceforth to be his lot. The town was sated with
this species of entertainment, and the Chevalier’s house was
empty. Still, accustomed to take the highest place, he would not
yield to a “novice.” Accordingly, he directed his steps to Parma
immediately, and established himself in a theatre just opposite
to De Grisy’s. In vain! He had the mortification of seeing his
house deserted, while his rival’s was constantly filled. Nevertheless,
Pinetti would not yield, but wheresoever De Grisy went
he followed.</p>

<p>Thus were visited, one after another, Piacenza, Cremona,
Mantua, Vicenza, Padua, and Venice, whose walls witnessed the
embittered strife of the two rivals, until Pinetti, whose most zealous
supporters were turning recreant, could blind himself no
longer to the fact that he had lost the game which he and De
Grisy had been playing. He closed his theatre and betook himself
to Russia.</p>

<p>For a short time it seemed as though Fortune would indemnify
him for his ill luck. But, after having for so long showered
her favors on him, it now appeared that she had finally and
definitely turned her back upon him. Long and severe illness
exhausted not only his vigor, but the slender means he had saved
from shipwreck. Pinetti fell into the most
abject want. A <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
nobleman in the village of Bartitschoff in Volhynien took him
in from pity. And thus, at the turn of the century, ended the life
of this richly gifted artist, who was so wanting in nobility of
spirit.</p>

<p>The extraordinary story of Pinetti’s downfall was told to
Robert-Houdin by De Grisy himself, and is given at length in
Houdin’s memoirs. Pinetti had married a Russian girl, the
daughter of a carriage-maker. By her he had two children.
He was hardly fifty when he died. Etienne-Gaspard Robertson
when traveling in Russia met the widow Pinetti at Bialistock.
She showed him her husband’s cabinet of physics and endeavored
to sell it to him, but he did not purchase it. However, he
bought a medallion, set with diamonds, and a ring which the
Czar had presented to Pinetti. Says Robertson, in his memoirs:
“Pinetti had the audacity to ask the Russian Emperor to stand
god-father for his children at the baptismal font, and the
Emperor actually consented.”</p>

<p>To me this seems nothing wonderful.</p>

<p>Why should not the greatest conjurer of the age ask a favor
of the greatest autocrat? Both were sovereigns in their particular
domain.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">In the summer of 1893, I was in Paris, partly on business,
partly on pleasure. In the <i>Figaro</i> one day, shortly after my
arrival, I read about the marvelous exhibitions of magic of
M. Caroly, who was attracting crowds to his <i>séances diaboliques</i>
at the Capucine Theatre of the Isola Brothers. I went to see
the nineteenth-century necromancer exhibit his marvels. I saw
some very clever illusions performed during the evening, but
nothing that excited my especial interest as a devotee of the
weird and wonderful, until the pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur came to his
<i>pièce de résistance</i>—the Mask of Balsamo. That aroused my
flagging attention. M. Caroly brought forward a small table,
undraped, which he placed in the center aisle of the theatre; and
then passed around for examination the mask of a man, very
much resembling a death-mask, but unlike that ghastly <i>memento
mori</i> in the particulars that it was exquisitely modeled in wax
and artistically colored.</p>

<p>“Messieurs et mesdames,” said the professor of magic and
mystery, “this mask is a perfect likeness of Joseph Balsamo,
Count de Cagliostro, the famous sorcerer
of the eighteenth <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
century. It is a reproduction of a death-mask which is contained
in the secret museum of the Vatican at Rome. Behold! I lay
the mask upon this table in your midst. Ask any question you
please and it will respond.”</p>

<p>The mask rocked to and fro with weird effect at the bidding
of the conjurer, rapping out frequent answers to queries put by
the spectators. It was an ingenious electrical trick.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">7</a>
Being
already acquainted with the secret of the surprising experiment
in natural magic, I evinced no emotion at the extraordinary
behavior of the mask. But I was intensely interested in the
mask itself. Was it indeed a true likeness of the great Cagliostro,
the prince of charlatans? I repaired to the manager’s
office at the close of the <i>soirée magique</i>, and sought an introduction
to M. Caroly.</p>

<p>“Is monsieur an aspiring amateur who wishes to take lessons
in legerdemain?”</p>

<p>“No!” I replied.</p>

<p>“Pardon! Then monsieur is desirous of purchasing the
secrets of some of the little <i>jeux</i>?”</p>

<p>I replied as before in the negative. The manager shrugged
his shoulders, toyed with his ponderous watch-chain, and elevated
his eyebrows inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I simply wish to ascertain whether the mask of Balsamo
was really modeled from a genuine death-mask of the old-world
wizard.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I can answer that question,” said the theatrical
man, “without an appeal to the artist who performed this evening.
It was taken from a likeness of the eighteenth-century
sorcerer, not a death-mask as stated, but a rare old medallion
cast in the year 1785. Unfortunately this is not in
our possession.”</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc7" id="fn7">7</a>
“The secret of the trick is as follows: That part of the wood which
forms the chin is replaced by a small strip of iron, which is painted the same
color as the mask, so that it cannot be seen; an electro-magnet is let into
the top of the table, so that the cores shall be opposite the strip of iron when
the mask is laid upon the table. Contact is made by means of a push-button
somewhere in the side scenes; the wires run under the stage, and connection
is made through the legs of the table when the legs are set on the foreordained
place.”—Hopkins’ <i>Magic</i>, etc.</p></div>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span></div>

<p>I thanked the manager for his information. The story
about the death-mask in the possession of the Vatican was simply
a part of the pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur’s patter, but everything is permissible
in a conjuring séance.</p>

<p>I went home to the little hotel where I lodged in the historic
Rue de Beaune, a stone’s throw from the house where Voltaire
died. In my bedroom, over the carved oak mantel, was a curious
old mirror set in a tarnished gilt frame, a relic of the eighteenth
century. Said I to myself: “Would this were a ghost-glass,
a veritable mirror of Nostradamus, wherein I might conjure
up a phan­tas­ma­goria of that vanished Paris of long ago.” Possessed
with this fantastic idea, I retired to rest, closed in the
crimson curtains of the antique four-poster, and was soon wafted
into the land of dreams. Strange visions filled my brain. In the
mirror I seemed to see Cagliostro searching for the “elixir of
life,” in the laboratory of the Hotel de Strasbourg, while near
him stood the Cardinal de Rohan, breathlessly awaiting the results
of the mystic operation. The red glow from the alchemist’s
furnace illumined the great necromancer with a coppery splendor.</p>

<p>Cagliostro! Cagliostro! I was pursued all the next day,
and for weeks afterward, with visions of the enchanter. “Ah,
wretched mask of Balsamo,” I said to myself, “why have you
bewitched me thus with your false oleaginous smile?” I took
to haunting the book-stalls and antiquarian shops of the Quai
Voltaire, in the hope of picking up some old medallion or rare
print of the arch-quack. The second-hand literature of the world
may be found here. Amid the flotsam and jetsam of old books
tossed upon this inhospitable shore of literary endeavor many
a precious Elzevir or Aldus has been picked up. My labors
were not in vain. I was fortunate in discovering a quaint little
volume, the life of Cagliostro, translated from the Italian work
printed under the auspices of the Apostolic Chamber, Rome,
1790. It was entitled <i>Vie de Joseph Balsamo, Connu Sous le
Nom de Comte Cagliostro. Traduite d’après l’original italien,
imprimé à la Chambre Apostolique; enrichie de Notes curieuses,
et ornée de son Portrait. Paris et Strasbourg, 1791.</i> The
frontispiece was an engraved portrait of
Cagliostro. Yes, here <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
was the great magician staring at me from out the musty, faded
pages of a quaint old chronicle. A world of cunning lay revealed
in the depths of his bold, gleaming eyes. His thick lips wore
a smile of Luciferian subtlety. Here, indeed, was a study for
Lavater. Here was the biography of the famous sorcerer of the
old régime, the prince of charlatans, who foretold the fall of the
Bastille, the bosom friend of the Cardinal de Rohan, and founder
of the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. Fascinated with the
subject of magic and magicians, I visited the Bibliothèque
Nationale and dipped into the literature on Cagliostro. Subsequently,
at the British Museum, I examined the rare brochures
and old files of the Courrier de l’Europe for information concerning
the incomparable necromancer, who made use of hypnotism,
and, like Mesmer, performed many strange feats of pseudo-magic,
and made numerous cures of diseases which baffled the
medicos of the time.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">8</a></p>

<p>Goethe<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9" id="fnanc9">9</a>
and Catharine II. wrote plays about him; George
Sand introduced him into her novel, “The Countess of Rudolstadt;”
Alexander Dumas made him the hero of several
romances; Scribe, St. Georges, and Adam in the year 1844
brought out “Cagliostro,” a comic opera in three acts, which
was successfully performed at the Opéra Comique, Paris; Alexander
Dumas <i>fils</i> wrote a drama in five acts called “Joseph Balsamo”
which was produced at the Odéon, March 18, 1878; and
Thomas Carlyle philosophized concerning him.</p>

Cagliostro is to be found in “Börsenblatt fürden deutschen

C.</p></div>

<p>To understand Cagliostro, one must understand the period
in which he lived and acted his strange world-drama, its philosophical
and religious background. The arch-enchanter appeared
on this mortal scene when the times were “out of joint.” It
was the latter part of that strange, romantic eighteenth century
of scepticism and credulity. The old world like a huge Cheshire
cheese was being nibbled away from within,
until little but the <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
rind was left to tell the tale. The rotten fabric of French society,
in particular, was about to tumble down in the sulphurous flames
of the Revolution, and the very people who were to suffer most
in the calamity were doing their best to assist in the process
of social and political disintegration. The dogmas of the Church
were bitterly assailed by learned men. But the more sceptical
the age, the more credulity extant. Man begins by denying,
and then doubts his doubts. Charles Kingsley says: “And so it
befell, that this eighteenth century, which is usually held to be
the most ‘materialistic’ of epochs, was in fact a most ‘spiritualistic’
one.” The soil was well fertilized for the coming of Cagliostro,
the sower of super­sti­tion. Every variety of mysticism
appealed to the imaginative mind. There were societies of Illuminati,
Rosicrucians, and Alchemists.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>Speaking of the great charlatan, the Anglo-Indian essayist
Greeven in an article published a few years ago
in the <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
<i>Calcutta
Review</i> writes: “It is not enough to say that Cagliostro posed
as a magician, or stood forth as the apostle of a mystic religion.
After all, in its mild way, our own generation puts on its evening
dress to worship at the feet of mediums, whose familiar spirits
enable them to wriggle out of ropes in cupboards, or to project
cigarette papers from the ceiling [<i>à la</i> Madame Blavatsky].
We ride our hobby, however, only when the whim seizes us,
and, as soon as it wearies, we break it in pieces and fling it aside
with a laugh. But Cagliostro impressed himself deeply on the
history of his time. He flashed on the world like a meteor.
He carried it by storm. Princes and nobles thronged to his
‘magic operations.’ They prostrated themselves before him for
hours. His horses and his coaches and his liveries rivaled a
king’s in magnificence. He was offered, and refused, a ducal
throne. No less illustrious a writer than the Empress of Russia
deemed him a worthy subject of her plays. Goethe made him
the hero of a famous drama. A French Cardinal and an English
Lord were his bosom companions. In an
age which arrogated <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>

<h3 class="h3mid">II.</h3>

<p>And now for a brief review of his life. Joseph Balsamo,
the son of Peter Balsamo and Felicia Braconieri, both of humble
extraction, was born at Palermo, on the eighth day of June,
1743. He received the rudiments of an education at the Seminary
of St. Roche, Palermo. At the age of thirteen, according
to the Inquisition biographer, he was intrusted to the care of the
Father-General of the Benfratelli, who carried him to the Convent
of that Order at Cartagirone. There he put on the habit of
a novice, and, being placed under the tuition of the apothecary,
he learned from him the first principles of chemistry and medicine.
He proved incorrigible, and was expelled from the monastery
in disgrace. Then began a life of dissipation in the city
of Palermo. He was accused of forging theatre-tickets and
a will. Finally he had to flee the city for having duped a goldsmith
named Marano of sixty pieces of gold, by promising to
assist him in unearthing a buried treasure by magical means.
The super­sti­tious Marano entered a cavern situated in the
environs of Palermo, according to instructions given to him by
the enchanter, and discovered, not a chest full of gold, but a
crowd of Balsamo’s confederates, who, disguised as infernal
spirits, administered to him a terrible castigation. Furious at the
deception, the goldsmith vowed to assassinate the pretended
sorcerer. Balsamo, however, took wing to Messina, where he
fell in with a strolling mountebank and alchemist named Althotas,
or Altotas, who spoke a variety of languages. They traveled
to Alexandria in Egypt, and finally brought up at the island
of Malta. Pinto, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta,
was a searcher after the philosopher’s stone, an enthusiastic
alchemist. He extended a warm reception to the two adventurers,
and took them under his patronage. They remained for
some time at Malta, working in the laboratory
of the deluded <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
Pinto. Eventually Althotas died, and Balsamo went to Naples,
afterwards to Rome, where he married a beautiful girdle-maker,
named Lorenza Feliciani. Together with a swindler calling himself
the Marchese d’Agliata, he had a series of disreputable adventures
in Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Unmasked at one place,
he fled in hot haste to another.</p>

<p>In 1776 he arrived in London. He had assumed various
aliases during the course of his life, but now he called himself
the “Conte di Cagliostro.” The title of nobility was assumed,
but the name of Cagliostro was borrowed from an uncle on his
mother’s side of the house, Joseph Cagliostro, of Messina, who
was an agent or factor of the Prince of Villafranca. His beautiful
wife called herself the “Countess Serafina Feliciani.” Cagliostro
announced himself as a worker of wonders, especially in
medicine. He carried about two mysterious substances—a red
powder, known as his “Materia Prima,” with which he transmuted
baser metals into gold, and his “Egyptian Wine,” with
which he prolonged life.</p>

<p>He dropped hints that he was the son of the Grand-Master
Pinto of Malta and the Princess of Trebizonde. He foretold
the lucky numbers in a lottery and got into difficulty with a gang
of swindlers, which caused him to flee from England to avoid
being imprisoned. While in London he picked up, at a second-hand
book-stall, the mystic writings of an obscure spiritist, one
George Coston, “which suggested to him the idea of the Egyptian
ritual”; and he got himself initiated into a masonic lodge.
Henri d’Alméras (<i>Cagliostro: la Franc-Maçonnerie et l’Occultisme
au XVIII siècle, Paris, 1904</i>) states authoritatively that
the famous charlatan received the masonic degrees in the Esperance
Lodge, April 12, 1777. This lodge, composed mainly of
French and Italian residents in London, held its sessions at the
King’s Head Tavern (Gerard Street). It was attached to the
Continental Masonic order of the Higher Observance, which was
supposed to be a continuation and perfection of the ancient association
of the Knights Templars. According to Alméras, Cagliostro
was initiated under the name of Joseph Cagliostro, Colonel
of the 3d regiment of Brandenburg. On June 2, the Grand
Lodge of London gave him his masonic patent,
which is to <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
be found in the collection of autographs of the Marquis de
Chateaugiron, V. Catalogue, Paris, 1851. Cagliostro is regarded
as the greatest masonic imposter of the world. His pretentions
were bitterly repudiated by the English members of the fraternity,
and many of the Continental lodges. But the fact
remains that he made thousands of dupes. As Grand Master of
the Egyptian Rite he leaped at once into fame. His swindling
operations were now conducted on a gigantic scale. He had the
entrée into the best society. According to him, freemasonry
was founded by Enoch and Elias. It was open to both sexes.
Its present form, especially with regard to the exclusion of
women, is a corruption. The true form was preserved only by
the Grand Kophta, or High Priest of the Egyptians. By him it
was revealed to Cagliostro. The votaries of any religion are
admissible, subject to these conditions, (1) that they believe in
the existence of a God; (2) that they believe in the immortality
of the soul; and (3) that they have been initiated into common
Masonry. The candidate must swear an oath of secrecy, and
obedience to the Secret Superiors. It is divided into the usual
three grades of Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Mastermason.</p>

<p>In this system he promised his followers “to conduct them
to <i>perfection</i>, by means of a <i>physical and moral regeneration</i>; to
enable them by the former (or physical) to find the <i>prime matter</i>,
or Philosopher’s Stone, and the <i>acacia</i>, which consolidates in
man the forces of the most vigorous youth and renders him
immortal; and by the latter (or moral) to procure them a Pantagon,
which should restore man to his primitive state of innocence,
lost by original sin.”</p>

<p>Cagliostro declared Moses, Elias and Christ to be the Secret
Superiors of the Order, because having “attained to such perfection
in masonry that, exalted into higher spheres, they are able
to create fresh worlds for the glory of the Lord. Each is still
the head of a secret community.”</p>

<p>No wonder the Egyptian Rite became popular among lovers
of the marvelous, because it promised its votaries, who should
attain to perfection, or adeptship, the power of transmuting
baser metals into gold; prolonging life indefinitely
by means of <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
an elixir; communing with the spirits of the dead; and many
other necromantic feats and experiments.</p>

<p>The meetings of the Egyptian Lodges were in reality spiritualistic
séances. The medium was a young boy (<i>pupille</i>) or
young girl (<i>colombe</i>) in the state of virgin innocence, “to whom
power was given over the seven spirits that surround the throne
of the divinity, and preside over the seven planets.” The
Colombe would kneel in front of a globe of clarified water which
was placed upon a table covered with a black cloth, and Cagliostro
would summon the angels of the spheres to enter the globe,
whereupon the youthful clairvoyant would behold the visions
presented to view, and describe events transpiring in distant
places. “It would be hard,” says Count Beugnot, “to believe
that such scenes could have taken place in France at the end of
the eighteenth century; yet they aroused great interest among
people of importance in the Court and the town.”</p>

<p>In the mysticism of the twentieth century the above-mentioned
form of divination is known as “crystal gazing,” though
the medium employed is usually a ball of rock crystal, and not a
globe of water such as Cagliostro generally used. Occultism
classes all such experiments under the head of <i>magic mirrors</i>.
The practice is very ancient. The Regent d’Orléans of France
experimented with the magic mirror, as Saint Simon records.
The great traveler, Lane, speaks of such divination among the
modern Egyptians by means of ink held in the palm of the hand.
Mirrors of ivory, metal, and wood coated with gypsum have been
used. As Andrew Lang puts it: “There is, in short, a chain
of examples, from the Greece of the fourth century B. C., to the
cases observed by Dr. Mayo and Dr. Gregory in the middle of the
nineteenth century, and to those which Mrs. De Morgan wished
to explain by ‘spiritualism.’&#x202f;” In the opera “Parsifal” by
Richard Wagner, the necromancer, Klingsor, sees the approach
of the young knight in a magic mirror. In the Middle Ages the
use of these mirrors was well known. Deeply imbued with the
spirit of mediævalism, Wagner properly equipped the magician
of his sublime opera with the mirror.</p>

<p>Max Dessoir, the German psychologist, writes as follows
concerning the magic mirror (<i>Monist</i>, Vol.
I, No. 1): <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span></p>

<p>“The phenomena produced by the agency of the magic mirror
with regard to their contents proceed from the realm of the sub­con­scious­ness;
and that with regard to their <i>form</i> they belong
to the category of hal­luc­i­na­tions. . . . Hallucinations, the production
of which are facilitated by the fixation of shining surfaces,
do not occur with all persons; and there may be a kernel
of truth in the tradition which designates women and children
as endowed with especial capacities in this respect. The investigations
of Fechner upon the varying vividness of after-images;
the statistics of Galton upon hallucinatory phantasms in artists;
and the extensive statistical work of the Society for Psychical
Research, appear to point to a connection of this character. . . .
Along with the inner process the outward form of the hal­luc­i­na­tion
requires a brief explanation. The circumstance, namely,
which lends magic-mirror phenomena their salient feature, is
the sensory reproduction of the images that have sprung up from
the sub­con­scious­ness. The sub­ter­ranean ideas produced do not
reach the surface as thoughts, but as pseudo-perceptions.”</p>

<p>Cagliostro sometimes made use of a metallic mirror. This
fact we have on the authority of the Countess du Barry, the frail
favorite of Louis XV. When the “Well Beloved” went the way
of dusty death, the charming Countess divided her years of banishment
from the glories of the Court at her Chateau of
Luciennes and her houses in Paris and Versailles. She relates
that on one occasion the Cardinal de Rohan paid her a visit.
During the conversation the subject of Mesmer and magnetism
was discussed.</p>

<p>“My dear Countess,” said the Cardinal, “the magnetic
séances of Mesmer are not to be compared with the magic of my
friend the Count de Cagliostro. He is a genuine Rosicrucian,
who holds communion with the elemental spirits. He is able
to pierce the veil of the future by his necromantic power. Permit
me to introduce him to you.”</p>

<p>The curiosity of the Countess was excited, and she consented
to receive the illustrious sorcerer at her home. The next
day the Cardinal came, accompanied by Cagliostro. The magician
was magnificently dressed, but not altogether in good taste.
Diamonds sparkled on his breast and upon
his fingers. The <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
knob of his walking-stick was incrusted with precious stones.
Madame du Barry, however, was much struck with the power of
his bold, gleaming eyes. She realized that he was no ordinary
charlatan. After discussing the question of sorcery, Cagliostro
took from the breast pocket of his coat a leather case which he
handed to the Countess, saying that it contained a magic mirror
wherein she might read the events of the past and future. “If
the vision be not to your liking,” he remarked, impressively,
“do not blame me. You use the mirror at your own risk.”</p>

<p>She opened the case and saw a “metallic glass in an ebony
frame, ornamented with a variety of magical characters in gold
and silver.” Cagliostro recited some cabalistic words, and bade
her gaze intently into the glass. She did so, and in a few
minutes was overcome with fright and fainted away.</p>

<p>Such is the story as related by Du Barry in her memoirs,
which have been recently edited by Prof. Leon Vallée, librarian
of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p>

<p>She gives us no clew as to the vision witnessed by her in the
magic glass. She says she afterwards refused to receive Cagliostro
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>What are we to believe concerning this remarkable story?
We might possibly conjecture that she saw in the mirror a
phan­tas­ma­goria of the guillotine, and beheld her blonde head
“sneeze into the basket,” and held up to public execration. Coming
events cast their shadows before.</p>

<p>But all this is mere fancy, “midsummer madness,” as the
Bard of Avon has it.</p>

<p>God alone knows the future. Wisely has it been veiled
to us.</p>

<p>Possibly Madame la Comtesse from her subliminal consciousness
conjured up an hal­luc­i­na­tion of the loathsome death by
smallpox of her royal lover, at whose corpse even the “night
men” of Versailles recoiled with horror. Telepathy from Cagliostro
may have played a part in inducing the vision. Ah, who
knows! We leave the problem to the
psychologists for solution. <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span></p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>From England Cagliostro went to the Hague, where he
inaugurated a lodge of female masons, over which his wife presided
as Grand Mistress. Throughout Holland he was received
by the lodges with masonic honors—beneath “arches of steel.”
He discoursed volubly upon magic and masonry to enraptured
thousands. In March, 1779, he made his appearance at Mitau,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn10" id="fnanc10">10</a>
in the Baltic Provinces, which he regarded as the stepping-stone
to St. Petersburg. He placed great hope in Catherine II of
Russia—“the avowed champion of advanced thought.” He
hoped to promulgate widely his new and mysterious religious
cult in the land of the Czars, with all the pomp and glamour of
the East. The nobility of Kurland received him with open arms.
Some of them offered to place him on the ducal throne, so he
claimed. He wisely refused the offer. Cagliostro eventually
made a fiasco at Mitau and left in hot haste. In St. Petersburg
his stay was as short. Catherine II was too clever a woman
to be his dupe. She ordered the charlatan to leave Russia, which
he forthwith did. Prospects of Siberia doubtless hastened his
departure. In May, 1780, he turned up at Warsaw. A leading
prince lodged him in his palace. Here Cagliostro “paraded
himself in the white shoes and red heels of a noble.” His
spirit séances were not a success. He chose as his clairvoyant
a little girl, eight years of age. After pouring oil into her hands,
he closed her in a room, the door of which was hung with a black
curtain. The spectators sat outside. He interrogated the child
concerning the visions that appeared to her. Among other
tests, he requested the spectators to inscribe their names on a
piece of paper which he appeared to burn before their very eyes.
Calling to the child that a note would flutter down at her feet,
he requested her to pass it to him through the door. He passed
his hand through the opening of the door to receive the note.
In the next instant he produced a note closed with a freemason’s
seal, which contained the signatures of the spectators.
This was nothing more than the trick of a
pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur, such <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
as was performed by Philadelphia and Pinetti, the two great
sleight of hand artists of the period. The next day the clairvoyant
confessed the fact that she had been tutored by the magician,
and that the visions were but figments of the imag­i­na­tion. Cagliostro
secured a new subject, a girl of sixteen, but had the folly
to fall in love with his accomplice. In exasperation she repeated
the confession of her predecessor. The Polish nobles now
insisted that Cagliostro invoke the spirit of the Grand Kophta
(the Egyptian High Priest). This séance took place “in a dark
room, on a sort of stage, lit with two candles only, and filled
with clouds of incense.” The Grand Kophta appeared. Through
the uncertain light the spectators beheld an imposing figure
in white robes and turban. A snowy beard fell upon its breast.</p>

Aufenthalt in Mithau im Jahre, 1779, und von dessen dortigen
magischen Operationen.</i>—Charlotte Elisabeth von der Recke. Berlin
und Stettin, 1787. 8vo.</p></div>

<p>“What see ye?” cried in a hoarse voice the sage of the pyramids.</p>

<p>“I see,” replied a sceptical gentleman from the audience,
“that Monsieur le Comte de Cagliostro has disguised himself
with a mask and a white beard.”</p>

<p>Everybody recognized the portly figure of the vision. A
rush seemed imminent. Quick as thought, the Grand Kophta,
by a wave of his hands, extinguished the two candles. A sound
followed as the slipping off of a mantle. The tapers were relit.
Cagliostro was observed sitting where the sage had disappeared.</p>

<p>At Wola, in a private laboratory, he pretended to transmute
mercury into silver. The scene must have been an impressive
one. Girt with a freemason’s apron, and standing on a black
floor marked with cabalistic symbols in chalk, Cagliostro worked
at the furnace. In the gloom of twilight the proceedings were
held. By a clever substitution of crucibles, Cagliostro apparently
accomplished the feat of transmutation, but the fraud was
detected the next morning, when one of the servants of the
house discovered the original crucible containing the mercury,
which had been cast upon a pile of rubbish by the pretended
alchemist, or one of his confederates.</p>

<p>In September, 1780, Cagliostro arrived in Strasburg. Here
he was received with unbounded enthusiasm. He lavished
money right and left, cured the poor without pay, and treated the
great with haughtiness. Just outside of the city
he erected a <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
country villa in Chinese architecture, wherein to hold his Egyptian
lodges. This place was long pointed out as the Cagliostræum.
The peasants are said to have passed it with uncovered
heads, such was their admiration and awe of the great wonder-worker.
At Strasburg resided at that time the Cardinal Louis
de Rohan, who was anxious to meet the magician. Cagliostro,
to whom the fact was reported, said: “If the Cardinal is sick,
he may come to me and I will cure him; if he is well, he has no
further need of me, nor I of him.” Cardinal de Rohan, Grand
Almoner of France, Commander of the order of the Holy Ghost,
enormously rich, and an amateur dabbler in alchemy and the
occult sciences, was now more anxious than ever to become
acquainted with the charlatan. Such disdain on the part of a
layman was a new experience to the haughty churchman. His
imag­i­na­tion, too, was fired by the stories told of the enchanter.
The upshot of it was that Cagliostro and the Cardinal became
bosom friends. The prelate invited the juggler and his wife to
live at his episcopal palace.</p>

<p>The Baroness d’Oberkirch, who saw him there, says in her
memoirs:<a class="afnanc" href="#fn11" id="fnanc11">11</a>
“No one can ever form the faintest idea of the fervor
with which everybody pursued Cagliostro. He was surrounded,
besieged; every one trying to win a glance or a word. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. A
dozen ladies of rank and two actresses had followed him in order
to continue their treat­ment. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. If I had not seen it, I should
never have imagined that a Prince of the Roman Church, a man in
other respects intelligent and honorable, could so far let himself
be imposed upon as to renounce his dignity, his free will, at the
bidding of a sharper.”</p>

<p>Cagliostro said to the Cardinal one day: “Your soul is
worthy of mine, and you deserve to be the confidant of all my
secrets.” He presented the Cardinal with a diamond worth
20,000 francs which he pretended to have made, the churchman
claiming to have been an eye-witness of the operation. The
Cardinal said to the Baroness: “But that is not all; he makes
gold; he has made five or six thousand francs worth before me,
up there in the top of the palace. I am to have more; I am to
have a great deal; he will make me the richest
prince in Europe <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>
These are not dreams, madame; they are proofs. And his
prophecies that have come true! And the miraculous cures that
he has wrought! [<i>He really cured the Cardinal of the asthma.</i>]
I tell you, he is the most extraordinary man, the sublimest man
in the world.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn12" id="fnanc12">12</a></p>

to note that Cagliostro was recommended as a physician to
our Benjamin Franklin, at that time residing in Paris. See
Hale’s <i>Franklin in France</i>, vol. 2, p. 226.</p></div>

<p>From Strasburg Cagliostro went to Naples, and from thence
to Bordeaux. After residing at Bordeaux for eleven months,
he proceeded to Lyons in great pomp, with lackeys, grooms,
guards armed with battle-axes, and heralds garbed in cloth of
gold, blowing trumpets. In the year 1785 he founded at Lyons
the Lodge of Triumphant Wisdom, and made many converts
to his mystical doctrines. The fame of his Egyptian masonry
reached Paris and created quite a stir among the lodges. The
chiefs of a masonic convocation assembled in Paris wrote to him
for information concerning his new rite. He scornfully refused
to have anything to do with them, unless they burned all their
masonic books and implements as useless trash and acknowledged
their futility, claiming that his Egyptian Rite was the
only true freemasonry and worthy of cultivation among men of
learning. His next move was to the French capital. Behold
him on his travels with coach-and-four, flunkies and outriders
in gorgeous liveries of red and gold; vehicles filled with baggage
and paraphernalia. Best of all, he carries with him an iron coffer
which contains the silver, gold, and jewels reaped from his dupes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>Cagliostro’s greatest triumph was achieved in Paris. A gay
and frivolous aristocracy, mad after new sensations, welcomed
the magician with open arms. The way had been paved for
him by St. Germain and Mesmer. He made his appearance in
the French capital, January 30, 1785. Fantastic stories were
circulated about him. The Cardinal de Rohan selected and
furnished a house for him, and visited him three or four times
a week, arriving at dinner time and remaining
until an advanced <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
hour in the night. It was said that the great Cardinal assisted
the sorcerer in his labors, and many persons spoke of the mysterious
laboratory where gold bubbled and diamonds sparkled in
crucibles brought to a white heat. But nobody except Cagliostro,
and perhaps the Cardinal, ever entered that mysterious
laboratory. All that was known for a certainty was that the
apartments were furnished with Oriental splendor, and that
Count Cagliostro in a dazzling costume received his guests with
kingly dignity, and gave them his hand to kiss. Upon a black
marble slab in the antechamber carved in golden letters was the
universal prayer of Alexander Pope. “Father of all! in every
age,” etc., the parody of which ten years later Paris sang as a
hymn to the Supreme Being.</p>

<p>Says Funck-Brentano:<a class="afnanc" href="#fn13" id="fnanc13">13</a>
“At Paris Cagliostro showed himself
what he had been at Strasburg, dignified and reserved. He
refused with haughtiness the invitations to dinner sent to him
by the Count of Artois, brother of the king, and the Duke of
Chartres, prince of the blood. He proclaimed himself chief of
the Rosicrucians, who regarded themselves as chosen beings
placed above the rest of mankind, and he gave to his adepts the
rarest pleasure. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. To all who pressed him with questions as
to who he was, he replied in a grave voice, knitting his eyebrows
and pointing his forefinger towards the sky, ‘I am he who
is’; and as it was difficult to make out that he was ‘he who is
not,’ the only thing was to bow with an air of profound deference.</p>

<p>“He possessed the science of the ancient priests of Egypt.
His conversation turned generally on three points: (1) Universal
Medicine, of which the secrets were known to him. (2)
Egyptian Freemasonry, which he wished to restore, and of
which he had just established a parent lodge at Lyons, for Scotch
masonry, then predominant in France, was in his eyes only an
inferior, degenerate form. (3) The Philosopher’s Stone, which
was to ensure the transmutation of all the imperfect metals into
fine gold.” <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span></p>

<i>The Diamond Necklace. Being the true Story of Marie
Antoinette and the Cardinal de Rohan. From the new documents
recently discovered in Paris.</i> By Frantz Funck-Brentano. Translated
from the French by H. S. Edwards. Philadelphia, 1901. 8vo.</p></div>

<p>“He thus gave to humanity, by his universal medicine, bodily
health; by Egyptian masonry, spiritual health; and by the philosopher’s
stone, infinite wealth.” These were his principal secrets,
but he had a host of others, that of predicting the winning numbers
in lotteries; prophesying as to the future; softening marble
and restoring it to its pristine hardness; of giving to cotton
the lustre and softness of silk, which has been re-invented in our
day by a chemical process.</p>

<p>Many writers on magic have fancied that the art of making
gold was the secret that lay hid under the forms of Egyptian
theology. Says the Benedictine monk, Pernetz: “The hermetic
science was the source of all the riches of the Egyptian kings,
and the object of these mysteries so hidden under the veil of their
pretended religion.” In a subterranean chamber beneath the
Great Pyramid of Gizeh, Hermes Trismegistus is supposed,
according to mediæval alchemists, to have placed his Table of
Emerald, upon which he engraved the secret of transmuting
metals into gold.</p>

<p>Among the many stories told of Cagliostro, that of the supper
in the hotel of the Rue Saint Claude, where the ghosts made
merry, is the most extraordinary. Six guests and the host took
their places at a round table upon which there were thirteen
covers. Each guest pronounced the name of the dead man whose
spirit he desired to appear at the banquet table. Cagliostro, concentrating
his mysterious forces, gave the invitation in a solemn
and commanding tone. One after another the six guests
appeared. They were the Duc de Choiseul, Voltaire, d’Alembert,
Diderot, the Abbé de Voisenon, and Montesquieu.</p>

<p>The story of this spirit séance created a sensation in Paris.
It reached the court, and one evening, when the conversation
turned upon the banquet of the ghosts, Louis XVI frowned,
shrugged his shoulders, and resumed his game of cards. The
queen became indignant, and forbade the mention of the name
of the charlatan in her presence. Nevertheless, some of the
light-headed ladies of the court burned for an introduction to the
superb sorcerer. They begged Lorenza Feliciani to get him to
give them a course of lectures or lessons in magic to which no
gentlemen were to be admitted. Lorenza replied that he would
consent, provided there were thirty-six pupils. The
list was made <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span>
up in a day, and a week afterward the fair dames got their first
lesson. But they gossiped about it. This caused another scandal,
and consequently the first lesson was the last.</p>

<p>Cagliostro’s Egyptian Rite of Masonry was well received in
Paris, especially the lodge for ladies, which was presided over by
the beautiful Lorenza, his wife. It was appropriately called
<i>Isis</i>. Among the members of this female lodge were the
Countesses de Brienne, Dessalles, de Polignac, de Brassac, de
Choiseul, d’Espinchal, the Marchioness d’Avrincourt, and Mmes.
de Loménie, de Genlis, de Bercy, de Trevières, de Baussan, de
Monteil, d’Ailly, etc.</p>

<p>Cagliostro lived like a lord, thanks to the revenues obtained
from the initiates into his masonic rite, and the money which he
unquestionably received from his dupe, the Cardinal de Rohan,
who was magic mad.</p>

<p>“His wife,” says a gossipy writer, “was rarely seen, but by
all accounts she was a woman of bewildering beauty, realizing
the Greek lines in all their antique purity and enhanced by an
Italian expression. The most enthusiastic of her so-called
admirers were precisely those who had never seen her face.
There were many duels to decide the question as to the color of
her eyes, some contending that they were black, and others that
they were blue. Duels were also fought over the dimple which
some admirers insisted was on the right cheek, while others said
that the honor belonged to the left cheek. She appeared to be
no more than twenty years old, but she spoke sometimes of her
eldest son, who was for some years a captain in the Dutch
army.”</p>

<p>The magician’s sojourn in Paris caused the greatest excitement.
His portrait and that of his wife were to be seen everywhere,
on fans, on rings, on snuff-boxes, and on medallions.
His bust was cut in marble by the famous sculptor, Houdon, cast
in bronze, and placed in the mansions of the nobility. He was
called by his admirers “the divine Cagliostro.” To one of the
old portraits was appended the following verse:</p>

<p>Hats and neckties were named after him. In Paris as in
Strasburg, he gave away large sums of money to the poor and
cured them of their ailments free of charge. His mansion was
always crowded with noble guests. The idle aristocracy could
find nothing better to do than attend the spirit séances of the
charlatan. The shades of Voltaire, Rousseau, and other dead
celebrities were summoned from the “vasty deep,” impersonated
doubtless by clever confederates in the pay of Cagliostro, often
aided by mechanical and optical accessories. The art of phan­tas­ma­goria,
in which the concave mirror plays a part, was well
known to the enchanter. The Count de Beugnot gives in detail,
in his interesting autobiography, an account of Cagliostro’s
performances at the residences of Madame de la Motte and the
Cardinal de Rohan. The niece of Count de la Motte,
a Mlle. de <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
la Tour, a charming girl of fifteen, frequently acted as clairvoyant
in the mystical séances. She is reported to have possessed
all the requisites of a seeress: angelic purity, delicate nerves, and
blue eyes, also to have been born under the constellation Capricorn.
“Her mother nearly died of joy.”</p>

<p>Says Count Beugnot: “When she learned that her child fulfilled
all these conditions of Egyptian thaumaturgy, she thought
the treasures of Memphis and of that large city in the interior
of Africa were about to fall upon her family, which was badly
in need of them.” In the report of the necklace trial (Arch.
Nat. X2, B‐1417), the young girl confesses to have aided the
charlatan in his magical operations at the house of the Cardinal,
by pretending to see visions of Marie Antoinette and others in
a globe of water, which was surrounded by lighted tapers and
figures of Isis and Apis. He had decked her out in a freemason’s
apron embroidered with cabalistic characters. She aided
him because “she did not want to be bothered,” and answered his
leading questions, etc. But there was perhaps another reason
for her acquiescence in the fraud. Cagliostro had declared to
her, in the presence of the prelate, her aunt and mother, when she
first attempted to play the part of pythoness and failed, that her
inability to see anything in the globe was evidence that she was
not innocent. Stung by his inuendos, she immediately yielded
and saw all she was desired to see, thereby becoming his confederate
to deceive De Rohan.</p>

<p>An interesting pen portrait of Cagliostro is contained in
Beugnot’s memoirs. The Count met the enchanter for the first
time at the house of Madame de la Motte:</p>

<p>“Cagliostro was of medium height, rather stout, with an
olive complexion, a very short neck, round face, two large eyes
on a level with the cheeks, and a broad, turned-up nose. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;.
His hair was dressed in a way new to France, being divided into
several small tresses that united behind the head, and were
twisted up into what was then called a club.</p>

<p>“He wore on that day an iron gray coat of French make,
with gold lace, a scarlet waistcoat trimmed with broad Spanish
lace, red breeches, his sword looped to the skirt of his coat, and
a laced hat with a white feather, the latter
a decoration still <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
required of mountebanks, tooth-drawers and other medical practitioners,
who proclaim and retail their drugs in the open air.
Cagliostro set off this costume by lace ruffles, several valuable
rings, and shoe-buckles which were, it is true, of antique design,
but bright enough to be taken for real diamonds. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. The face,
attire, and the whole man made an impression on me that I
could not prevent. I listened to the talk. He spoke some sort
of medley, half French and half Italian, and made many quotations
which might be Arabic, but which he did not trouble himself
to translate. I could not remember any more of [his conversation]
than that the hero had spoken of heaven, of the stars,
of the Great Secret, of Memphis, of the high-priest, of transcendental
chemistry, of giants and monstrous beasts, of a city ten
times as large as Paris, in the middle of Africa, where he had
correspondents.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn14" id="fnanc14">14</a></p>

<p>Cagliostro often boasted of his great age.</p>

<p>One day in Strasburg, he stopped before a huge crucifix of
carved wood, and contemplated it with melancholy countenance.</p>

<p>“The likeness is excellent,” he remarked to one of his votaries,
“but I cannot understand how the artist, who certainly
never saw Christ, could have secured such a perfect portrait.”</p>

<p>“You knew Christ, then?” inquired the neophyte, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“We were on the most intimate terms.”</p>

<p>“My dear Count!—”</p>

<p>“I mean what I say. How often we strolled together on the
sandy shore of the Lake of Tiberias. How infinitely sweet his
voice. But, alas, he would not heed my advice. He loved to
walk on the seashore, where he picked up a band of <i>lazzaroni</i>—of
fishermen and beggars. This and his preaching brought him
to a bitter end.”</p>

<p>Turning to his servant, Cagliostro added: “Do you remember
that evening at Jerusalem when they crucified Christ?”</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur le Comte,” replied the well-tutored lackey,
bowing low, “you forget that I have only been in your employ
for the last fifteen hundred years.”</p>

<p>Baron Munchausen is not to be compared to Cagliostro. <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span></p>

<h3 class="h3mid">V.</h3>

<p>Cagliostro was at the height of his fame, when suddenly
he was arrested and thrown into the Bastille. He was charged
with complicity in the affair of the diamond necklace. Here is
his own account of the arrest: “On the 22d of August, 1785,
a commissaire, an exempt, and eight policemen entered my home.
The pillage began in my presence. They compelled me to open
my secretary. Elixirs, balms, and precious liquors all became
the prey of the officers who came to arrest me. I begged the
commissaire to permit me to use my carriage. He refused!
The agent took me by the collar. He had pistols, the stocks
of which appeared from the pockets of his coat. They hustled
me into the street and scandalously dragged me along the boulevard
all the way to the rue Notre Dame du Nazareth. There
a carriage appeared which I was permitted to enter to take the
road to the Bastille.”</p>

<p>What was this mysterious affair of the diamond necklace
which led to his incarceration in a state prison? In brief the
story is as follows:</p>

<p>The court jewelers, Böhmer and Bassange, had in their
possession a magnificent diamond necklace, valued at 1,800,000
livres, originally designed for the ivory neck of the fair but frail
Madame du Barry, mistress of Louis XV. But Louis—“the well
beloved”—died before the necklace was completed; the Sultana
went into exile, and the unlucky jewelers found themselves with
the diamond collar on their hands, instead of on the neck of
Du Barry. They were obliged to dispose of it, or become bankrupt.
Twice Böhmer offered it to Marie Antoinette, but she
refused to purchase it, or permit her husband, Louis XVI., to
do so, alleging that France had more urgent need of war ships
than jewels. Poor Böhmer, distracted at her refusal to buy
the necklace, threatened to commit suicide. The matter became
food for gossip among the <i>quid nuncs</i> of the Court. Unfortunate
necklace! it led to one of the most romantic intrigues of
history, involving in its jeweled toils a Queen, a cardinal, a courtesan
and a conjurer. Living at the village of Versailles at the
time was the Countess de la Motte, an
ex-mantua maker and <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
a descendant of an illegitimate scion of the Valois family who
had committed a forgery under Louis XIII. Her husband
was a sort of gentleman-soldier in the gendarmerie, a gambler,
and a rake. Madame de la Motte-Valois, boasting of the royal
blood that flowed in her veins, had many times petitioned the
King to assist her. A small pension had been granted, but it
was totally inadequate to supply her wants. She wished also
to gain a foothold at Versailles and flutter amidst the butterfly-countesses
of the <i>Salle de l’Oeil-de-Boeuf</i>. Looking about for
a noble protector, some one who could advance her claims, she
pitched upon the Cardinal de Rohan, who was the Grand
Almoner of the King. He supplied her with money, but accomplished
very little else for her. Though Grand Almoner and a
Cardinal, Louis de Rohan was <i>persona non grata</i> at the court.
He was cordially detested by Marie Antoinette not only because
of his dissolute habits, but on account of slanderous letters he
had written about her when she was still a Dauphiness. This
coldness on the part of the Queen caused the Cardinal great
anguish, as he longed to be Prime Minister, and sway the destinies
of France through the Queen like a second Richelieu,
Fleury or Mazarin. More than that, he loved the haughty
Antoinette. All these things he confided to Madame de la Motte.
When the story of Böhmer and the diamond necklace was noised
abroad, Madame de la Motte conceived a plot of wonderful
audacity. She determined to possess the priceless collar and
make the Cardinal the medium of obtaining it. She deluded the
Cardinal into the belief that she was in the Queen’s confidence.
She asserted that Marie Antoinette had at last yielded to her
pleadings for recognition as a descendant of the Valois and
granted her social interviews. She confided to him that the
Queen secretly desired to be reconciled to him. She became
the pretended “go-between” between the Cardinal and the
Queen, and delivered numerous little notes to him, signed
“Antoinette de France.” Finally she arranged an interview for
him, at night, in the park of Versailles, ostensibly with the
Queen, but in reality with a young girl named d’Oliva who bore
a remarkable resemblance to Marie Antoinette. The d’Oliva
saw him only for a few moments and presented him
with a rose. <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
The Cardinal was completely duped. “Madame de la Motte
persuaded him,” says Greeven, “into the belief that the Queen
was yearning for the necklace, but, as she could not afford it,
he could assure himself of her favor by becoming security for
the payment. She produced a forged instrument, which purported
to have been executed by the Queen, and upon which he
bound himself as security.” The necklace was delivered to the
Cardinal, who handed it over to Madame de la Motte, to be
given to Marie Antoinette. Thus it was, as Carlyle says, the
<i>collier de la reine</i> vanished through “the horn-gate of dreams.”</p>

<p>But, asks the curious reader, what has all this to do with
Cagliostro? What part had he to play in the drama? This:
When the Countess de la Motte was arrested, she attempted
to throw the blame of the affair upon the Cardinal and Cagliostro.
She alleged that they had summoned her into one of their
mystic séances. “After the usual hocus-pocus, the Cardinal made
over to her a casket containing the diamonds without their setting
and directed her to deliver them to her husband, with instructions
to dispose of them at once in London. Upon this information
Cagliostro and his wife were arrested. He was detained
without hearing, from the 22d of August, 1785, until the 30th
of January, 1786, when he was first examined by the Judges,
and he was not set at liberty till the 1st of June, 1786.”</p>

<p>The trial was the most famous in the annals of the Parliament.
Cagliostro and the Cardinal were acquitted with honor.
The Countess de la Motte was sentenced to be exposed naked,
with a rope around her neck, in front of the Conciergerie, and to
be publicly whipped and branded by the hangman with the letter
V (<i>Voleuse—thief</i>&#xa0;) on each shoulder. She was further sentenced
to life imprisonment in the prison for abandoned women.
She escaped from the latter place, however, to London, where
she was killed on the 23d day of August, 1791, by a fall from
a window. The Count de la Motte was sentenced <i>in contumacium</i>.
He was safe in London at the time and had disposed of
the diamonds to various dealers. The d’Oliva was set free
without punishment. The man who forged the letter for
Madame de la Motte, her secretary, Villette, was banished for
life. The Countess de Cagliostro
was honorably discharged. <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span></p>

<p>The Cardinal was unquestionably innocent, as was fully established
at the trial. His overweening ambition and his mad love
for Marie Antoinette had rendered him an easy dupe to the
machinations of the band of sharpers. But how about Cagliostro?
The essayist Greeven seems to think that the alchemist
was more or less mixed up in the swindle. He sums up the
suspicions as follows: “<i>First</i>, his [Cagliostro’s] immense influence
over the Cardinal, and his intimate relations with him
render it impossible that so gigantic a fraud could have been
practiced without his knowledge. <i>Second</i>, he was in league with
the Countess for the purpose of deceiving the Cardinal, in connection
with the Queen.”</p>

<p>M. Frantz Funck-Brentano writes: “The idea of implicating
Cagliostro in the intrigue had been conceived, as Georgel
says, with diabolical cunning. If Jeanne de Valois had in the
first instance made a direct accusation against Cardinal de Rohan,
no one would have believed in it. But there was something
mysterious and suspicious about Cagliostro, and it was known
what influence he exercised on the mind of the Cardinal. ‘The
alchemist,’ she suggested, ‘took the necklace to pieces in order
to increase by means of it the occult treasures of an unheard-of
fortune.’ ‘To conceal his theft,’ says Doillot
[Madame de la <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
Motte’s lawyer], ‘he ordered M. de Rohan, in virtue of the
influence he had established over him, to sell some of the diamonds
and to get a few of them mounted at Paris through the
Countess de la Motte, and to get more considerable quantities
mounted and sold in England by her husband.’ .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. Cagliostro
had one unanswerable argument: the Cardinal had made his
agreement with the jewelers on the 29th of January, 1785, and
he, Cagliostro, had only arrived in Paris at nine in the evening
of the 30th.”</p>

<p>Cagliostro refuted the charges with wonderful <i>sang froid</i>.
He appeared in court “proud and triumphant in his coat of
green silk embroidered with gold.” “Who are you? and whence
do you come?” asked the attorney for the crown.</p>

<p>“I am an illustrious traveler,” he answered bombastically.
Everyone present laughed. He then harangued the judges in
theatrical style. He told the most impossible stories of his
adventures in Arabia and Egypt. He informed the judges that
he was unacquainted with the place of his birth and the name
of his parents, but that he spent his infancy in Medina, Arabia,
and was brought up under the cognomen of Acharat. He
resided in the palace of the Great Muphti, and always had the
servants to attend his wants, besides his tutor, named Althotas,
who was very fond of him. Althotas told him that his (Cagliostro’s)
father and mother were Christians and nobles, who
died when he was three months old, leaving him in the care of
the Muphti. On one occasion, he asked his preceptor to tell him
the name of his parents. Althotas replied that it would be
dangerous for him to know, but some incautious expressions
dropped by the tutor led him to believe that they were from
Malta. When twelve years of age he began his travels, and
learned the languages of the Orient. He remained three years
in the sacred city of Mecca. The Sherif or Governor of that
place showed him such unusual attention and kindness, that he
oftentimes thought that personage was his father. He quitted
this good man with tears in his eyes, and never saw him again.</p>

<p>“Adieu, nature’s unfortunate child, adieu!” cried the Sherif
of Mecca to him, as he
took his departure. <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span></p>

<p>Whenever he arrived in any city, either of Europe, Asia, or
Africa, he found an account opened for him at the leading
banker’s or merchant’s. Like the Count of Monte Cristo, his
credit was unlimited. He had only to whisper the word
“Acharat,” and his wants were immediately supplied. He really
believed that the Sherif was the friend to whom all was owing.
This was the secret of his wealth. He denied all complicity in
the necklace swindle, and scornfully refuted the charge of
Madame de la Motte, that he was “an empiric, a mean alchemist,
a dreamer on the Philosopher’s Stone, a false prophet, a profaner
of true worship, the self-dubbed Count de Cagliostro.”</p>

<p>“As to my being a false prophet,” he exclaimed grandiloquently,
“I have not always been so; for I once prophesied to
the Cardinal de Rohan, that Madame de la Motte would prove
a dangerous woman, and the result has verified my prediction.”</p>

<p>In conclusion he said that every charge that Madame de la
Motte had preferred against him was false, and that she was
<i>mentiris impudentissime</i>, which two words he requested her
lawyers to translate for her, as it was not polite to tell her so in
French.</p>

<p>The Inquisition biographer, regarding the subject of the
necklace, says: “It is difficult to decide whether, in this celebrated
affair, Madame de la Motte or the Count Cagliostro had
the greatest share of glory. It is certain, however, that both
of them acquired uncommon <i>éclat</i>, and indeed attempted to
surpass each other. We cannot affirm that they acted in concert
on this memorable occasion; we can, however, with safety assert
that Cagliostro was well acquainted with the designs of this
woman, so wonderfully formed for intrigue, and that he always
kept his eye steadily fixed upon the famous necklace. He certainly
perceived, and has indeed <i>confessed in his interrogatories</i>
[the italics are mine], <i>that he was acquainted with all the
manoeuvres which she put in practice to accomplish her criminal
designs</i>.</p>

<p>“The whole affair was at length discovered. He had foreseen
this; and wished to have evaded the inevitable consequences
attendant on detection; but it was now too late. The officers of
the police were persuaded that without his aid
this piece of <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
roguery and deception could never have been carried on; and he
was arrested and imprisoned in the Bastille. He, however, did
not lose courage; he even found means to corrupt his guards,
and to establish a correspondence with the other prisoners who
were confined along with him. It was owing to this that they
were enabled to be uniform in the answers which they gave in
to the various interrogatories to which they were obliged to
reply.</p>

<p>“Cagliostro, who has recounted the whole of the circumstances
to us, has added, of his own accord, that he denied
everything to his judges with the utmost intrepidity; and exhibited
such a sameness in his replies, that, on Madame de la Motte’s
being confronted with him, and finding herself unable to quash
his evidence, she became so furious, that she threw a candlestick
at his head in the presence of all his judges. By this means he
was declared innocent.”</p>

<p>So much for the Inquisition biography. The incident of the
candlestick has been verified by the archives of the Parliament.</p>

<p>Cagliostro was acquitted.</p>

<p>He drove in triumph from the Bastille to his residence, after
hearing his order of discharge. His coach was preceded by “a
fantastic cripple, who distributed medicines and presents among
the crowd.” He found the Rue Saint Claude thronged with
friends and sympathizers, anxious to welcome him home. At
this period revolutionary sentiments were openly vented by the
people of France. The throne was being undermined by the
philosophers and politicians. Any excuse was made to revile
Louis XVI and his queen. Scurrilous pamphlets were published
declaring that Marie Antoinette was equally guilty with the
de la Mottes in the necklace swindle. Cagliostro consequently
was regarded as a martyr to the liberties of man. His arrest
under the detested <i>lettre de cachet</i>, upon mere suspicion, and
long incarceration in the Bastille without trial, were indeed
flagrant abuses of justice and gave his sympathizers a whip with
which to lash the King and Court.</p>

<p>His wife had been liberated some time before him. She
met him at the door of the temple of magic, and he swooned in
her arms. Whether this was a genuine swoon or
not, it is <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
impossible to say, for Cagliostro was ever a <i>poseur</i> and never
neglected an opportunity for theatrical effect and self-advertisement.
He accused the Marquis de Launay, Governor of the
Bastille—he who had his head chopped off and elevated upon a
pike a few years later—of criminal misappropriation of his
effects, money, medicines, alchemical powders, elixirs, etc., etc.,
which he valued at a high sum. The Commissioner of Police
who arrested him was also included in this accusation. He
appealed to his judges, who referred him to the Civil Courts.
But the case never came to trial. The day after his acquittal
he was banished from France by order of the King. At St.
Denis “his carriage drove between two dense and silent lines of
well-wishers, while, as his vessel cleared from the port of Boulogne,
five thousand persons knelt down on the shore to receive
his blessing.” He went direct to London. No sooner there,
than he filed his suit against the Marquis de Launay, “appealing,
of course, to the hearts of all Frenchmen as a lonely and hunted
exile.” The French Government, through its ambassador,
granted him leave to come in person to Paris to prosecute his
suit, assuring him of safe conduct and immunity from all prosecution,
legal as well as social. But Cagliostro refused this offer,
hinting that it was merely a stratagem to decoy him to Paris
and reincarcerate him in a dungeon. No clear-headed, impartial
person believed that the Marquis de Launay was guilty of the
charge laid at his door. Whatever else he may have been, tyrannical,
cold, unsympathetic, the Governor of the Bastille was a
man of honor and above committing a theft. In fact, Cagliostro’s
accusation was a trumped-up affair, designed to annoy
and keep open “a running sore in the side of the French authorities.”
Notoriety is the life of charlatanry. Cagliostro
was no common quack, as his history shows. He next published
a pamphlet, dated June 20th, 1786, prophesying that
the Bastille would be demolished and converted into a public
promenade; and, that a ruler should arise in France, who should
abolish <i>lettres de cachet</i> and convoke the Estates-General. In a
few years the prediction was fulfilled. Poor De Launay lost
his life, whereupon Cagliostro issued a pamphlet exulting over
the butchery of his enemy. In London,
Cagliostro became the <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
bosom friend of the eccentric Lord George Gordon, the hero
of the “no-popery” riots. Eventually he became deeply involved
in debt, and was obliged to pawn his effects. He was unable
to impress the common-sense, practical English with his pretensions
to animal magnetism, transcendental medicine, and
occultism. One of his vaunted schemes was to light up the
streets of London with sea-water, which by his magic power
he proposed to change into oil. The
newspapers ridiculed him, <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
especially the <i>Courrier de l’Europe</i>, published and edited by M.
Morande, who had “picked up some ugly facts about the swindler’s
early career.” The freemasons repudiated him with scorn,
and would have nothing to do with his Egyptian Rite. There
is a rare old print, a copy of which may be seen in the Scottish
Rite Library, Washington, D. C., which depicts the unmasking
of the famous imposter at the Lodge of Antiquity, published
Nov. 21, 1786, at London. It was engraved by an eye-witness
of the scene. In company with some French gentlemen, Cagliostro
visited the lodge one evening. At the banquet which
followed the working of the degree, a certain worthy brother
named Mash, an optician, was called upon to sing. Instead
of a post-prandial ditty, he gave a clever imitation of a quack
doctor selling nostrums, and dilating bombastically upon the
virtues of his elixirs, balsams (Balsamos), and cordials. Cagliostro
was not slow in perceiving that he was the target for
Brother Mash’s shafts of ridicule. His “front of brass,” as
Carlyle has it, was beaten in, his pachyderm was penetrated by
the barbed arrows of the ingenious optician’s wit. He left the
hall in high dudgeon, followed by the jeers of the assembled
masons. Alas, for the Grand Kophta, no “vaults of steel,” no
masonic honors for him in London.</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">VI.</h3>

<p>To escape the harpies of the law, who threatened him with
a debtor’s prison, Cagliostro fled to his old hunting-ground,
the Continent, leaving <i>la petite Comtesse</i> to follow him as best
she could. But the game was played out. The police had by
this time become fully cognizant of his impostures. He was
forbidden to practice his peculiar system of medicine and
masonry in Austria, Germany, Russia, and Spain. Drawn like
a needle to the lodestone rock, he went to Rome. Foolish Grand
Kophta! Freemasonry was a capital offence in the dominions
of the Pope. One lodge, however, existed. Says Greeven:
“There is reason to suppose that it was tolerated only because
it enabled the Holy Church to spy out the movements of freemasons
in general.” Cagliostro attempted to found one of his
Egyptian lodges, but met with no success. His exchequer
became depleted. He appealed to the National Assembly of
France to revoke the order of banishment, on the ground of
“his services to the liberty of France.” Suddenly on the evening
of Dec. 27, 1789, he and his wife were arrested and incarcerated
in the fortress of San Angelo. His highly-prized manuscript
of Egyptian masonry was seized, together with all his papers
and correspondence. He was tried by the Holy Inquisition. It
must have been an impressive
scene—that gloomy council <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
chamber with the cowled inquisitors. Cagliostro’s wife appeared
against him and lifted the veil of Isis that hid the mysteries of
the charlatan’s career. The Egyptian manuscript of George
Coston, the seals, the masonic regalia and paraphernalia were
mute and damning evidences of his guilt. He was indeed a
freemason, even though he were not an alchemist, a soothsayer,
the Grand Kophta of the Pyramids. Cagliostro’s line of defense
was that “he had labored throughout to lead back freemasons,
through the Egyptian ritual, to Catholic orthodoxy.” He
appeared at first to be contrite. But it availed him nothing.
Finding his appeals for mercy useless, he adopted another tack,
and told impossible stories of his adventures. He harangued
the Holy Fathers for hours, despite their threats and protests.
Nothing could stop his loquacious tongue from wagging.
Finally, he was condemned to death as a heretic, sorcerer, and
freemason, but Pope Pius VI., on the 21st of March, 1791,
commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. His manuscript
was declared to be “super­sti­tious, blasphemous, wicked, and
heretical,” and was ordered to be burnt by the common hangman,
together with his masonic implements.</p>

<p>After the sentence of the Inquisition, Cagliostro was taken
back to the Castle of San Angelo and immured in a gloomy
dungeon, where no one but the jailer came near him. But still
his indomitable spirit was unconquered. He conceived a plan
of escape. Expressing the greatest contrition for his crimes,
he begged the Governor of the prison to send him a confessor.
The request was granted, and a Capuchin monk was detailed to
listen to the condemned man’s catalogue of sins. During the
confession, the charlatan suddenly sprang upon the monk and
endeavored to throttle him. His object was to escape from the
Castle in the Capuchin’s robe. But the Father Confessor proved
to be a member of the church militant, and vigorously defended
himself. Cagliostro’s attempt proved futile. This anecdote was
related by S. A. S. the Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar to the
French masonic historian, Thory (<i>Acta Latamorum</i>, I, 68).
The Prince declared it to be authentic.</p>

<p>Soon after the above-mentioned event, the Pontifical Government
ordered Cagliostro to be conducted in the
night time to <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
the Fortress of San Leon, in the Duchy of Urbino. Here in a
subterranean dungeon, it is said, he was literally swallowed up
alive, like the victims of mediæval days in the stone <i>in pace</i>.
From this epoch we lose all traces of the great necromancer.
It is said that he died in the month of August, 1795, the rigor
of his punishment having somewhat abated. The following item
will prove of interest: “News comes from Rome that the famous
Cagliostro is dead in the fortress of San Leon.” (<i>Moniteur
universel</i>, 6 Octobre, 1795. Correspondence dated from Genoa,
August 25th.) Everything concerning that death is shrouded
in mystery. The stone walls of San Leon have told no tales.
No one knows where the magician is buried. In all likelihood
in some ignoble prison grave. One can readily picture the obsequies:
A flash of flambeaux in the night; a coarse winding-sheet;
a wooden coffin; an indifferent priest to mumble a few Latin
prayers; the callous grave diggers with their spades—and all
is over! No masonic honors here; no arches of steel; no mystic
lights and regalia. Farewell forever, Balsamo! I confess a
weakness for you, despite your charlatanry. Doubtless you were
welcomed with open arms to the Shades by your brethren—the
Chaldeans, the sorcerers and the soothsayers.</p>

<p>Alfred de Caston, in his <i>Marchands de Miracles</i>, Paris 1864,
remarks that Cagliostro “rendered up his soul to God” just
one hundred years after the death of his predecessor in the <i>art
magique</i>, the brilliant charlatan Joseph Francis Borri of Milan,
who was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in the Castle of
St. Angelo by the Holy Inquisition, as a heretic, alchemist, and
sorcerer. A curious coincidence, says Castro.</p>

<p>The beautiful “Flower of Vesuvius,” Lorenza Feliciani,
escaped severe punishment by immuring herself in the convent
of St. Appolonia at Rome, where she died in 1794. She was
more sinned against than sinning.</p>

<p>There lived in 1858, an old woman known by the name
of Madeline, who inhabited a miserable attic in Paris, the ceiling
of which was covered with cabalistic and astrological emblems.
She pretended to divine the future and tell fortunes. She was
the daughter of Cagliostro and a Jewess of Lyons. (<i>Le Figaro</i>,
13 mai, 1858.) <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span></p>

<p>In the Inquisition biography some curious letters to Cagliostro
from his masonic correspondents in France are published.
They evidence the profound respect, one might almost say blind
worship, with which he was regarded by his disciples.</p>

<p>The masonic lodge at Rome was disrupted shortly after
Cagliostro’s arrest. The Sbirri of the Holy Office pounced down
upon it, but the birds had flown, taking with them their most
important papers. Father Marcellus says that among the members
of this Roman lodge were an Englishman and an American.</p>

<p>And so endeth the career of Cagliostro, one of the most
romantic of history. His condemnation as a sorcerer and freemason
has invested him with “the halo of a religious martyr,
of which perhaps no one was less deserving.”</p>

<p>Among his effects the Inquisition found a peculiar seal, upon
which the mysterious letters “L. P. D.” were engraved. These
letters were supposed to stand for the Latin sentence, <i>Lilia pedibus
destrue</i>, which rendered into the vulgar tongue signifies,
“Tread the lilies under foot.” The fleur-de-lys was the heraldic
device of the Bourbon Kings of France, hence this trampling
upon the lily alluded to the stamping out of the French monarchy
by the freemasons. However, it is more than probable
that the initials, arranged as follows, L. D. P., stood for <i>Libertè
de Penser</i>—“Freedom of thought”—which is a motto of Scottish
Rite Masonry. This was the opinion of General Albert
Pike, 33d degree, than whom no greater masonic student ever
lived.</p>

<p>Many theosophical writers have placed implicit belief in the
mission of Cagliostro. They have regarded him as a genuine
adept in magic and alchemy, and not a <i>chevalier d’industrie</i>
preying upon a credulous world. Totally ignoring the evidence
contained in the police archives<a class="afnanc" href="#fn16" id="fnanc16">16</a>
of Paris and the numerous
brochures by eminent men and women who personally knew
Cagliostro, they point to the Inquisition biography as a mass
of false evidence compiled by religious bigots, and consequently
unreliable, as if no other testimony regarding Cagliostro’s character
existed. Father Marcellus had an ecclesiastical axe to grind, <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
it is true, to prove Cagliostro a freemason and heretic (heinous
crimes in the eyes of the Roman Church, but absurd charges
in the eyes of all tolerant men), nevertheless he showed conclusively
that Joseph Balsamo of Palermo, the man of many
aliases, was also a charlatan, impostor and evil liver. All impartial
contemporary biographers corroborate the facts adduced
by the Inquisition in this respect. The Cardinal de Rohan is
not a competent witness for Cagliostro, for he was blinded by
his super­sti­tious belief in magic and alchemy. <i>Populus vult
decipi, decipiatur</i>—people who wish to be deceived are deceived.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc16" id="fn16">16</a>
See <i>Documents manuscrits</i> in the French archives at
Paris (Cartons: X2 B 1417—F7, 4445 B—Y, 11514—Y, 13125.)</p></div>

<p>Some writers have asserted that Cagliostro was the agent
of the Templars, and therefore wrote to the freemasons of
London that the time had arrived to begin the work of rebuilding
the Temple of the Eternal. With the heads of the Order he
had vowed to overturn the Throne and the Altar upon the tomb
of the martyred Grand Master of Templars, Jacques de Molai.
Learned in the esoteric doctrines of the Orient, the Knights
Templars, or Poor Fellow Soldiery of the Holy House of the
Temple, were accused of sorcery and witchcraft, hence their persecution
by the Church, and Philippe le Bel of France. De Molai,
before he was burned to death in Paris, organized and instituted
what afterwards became in the eighteenth century occult,
hermetic or Scottish Masonry. And thus the freemasons
traced their order to the Templars of the Middle Ages, from
whom they inherited the theosophical doctrines of Egypt and
India. Such is the romantic but improbable legend. Color is
lent to the story by Cagliostro himself. Among other Munchausen
tales related by him to his Inquisitors, he told how
he had visited the Illuminati of Frankfurt, when on his way to
Strasburg. In an underground cavern the secret Grand Master
of Templars “showed him his signature under a horrible form of
oath, traced in blood, and pledged him to destroy all despots,
especially in Rome.”</p>

<p>Taking this idea for a theme, Alexander the Great—he of
the pen, not of the sword—has built up a series of improbable
though highly romantic novels about the personality of Cagliostro,
entitled <i>The Memoirs of a Physician</i> and <i>The Diamond
Necklace</i>. He makes him the Grand Kophta of
a Society of <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
Illuminati, or exalted freemasons, which extends throughout
the world. Pledged to the propagation of liberty, equality, and
fraternity among men, the mystic brotherhood seeks to overthrow
the thrones of Europe and the Papacy, symbols of oppression
and persecution.</p>

<p><i>The Memoirs of a Physician</i> opens with a remarkable prologue,
descriptive of a solemn conclave of the secret superiors
of the Order. The meeting takes place at night in a ruined chateau
located in a mountainous region near the old city of Strasburg.
Cagliostro reveals his identity as the Arch-master of the
Fraternity, the Grand Kophta, who is in possession of the secrets
of the pyramids. He takes upon himself the important task of
“treading the lilies under foot” and bringing about the destruction
of the monarchy in France, the storm-centre of Europe. He
departs on his mission. Like Torrini, the conjurer, he has a
miniature house on wheels drawn by two Flemish horses. One
part of the vehicle is fitted up as an alchemical laboratory,
wherein the sage Althotas makes researches for the elixir of life.
Arriving at the chateau of a nobleman of the <i>ancien régime</i>,
Cagliostro meets the young dauphiness Marie Antoinette, on her
way to Paris, accompanied by a brilliant cortège. He causes
her to see in a carafe of water her death by the guillotine. Aided
by the freemasons of Paris, Cagliostro sets to work to encompass
the ruin of the throne and to bring on the great Revolution.
Dumas in this remarkable series of novels passes in review before
us Jean Jacques Rousseau, Cardinal de Rohan, Louis XV and
XVI, Marie Antoinette, Countess du Barry, Madame de la
Motte, Danton, Marat, and a host of people famous in the annals
of history. Cagliostro is exalted from a charlatan into an apostle
of liberty, endowed with many noble qualities. He is represented
as possessing occult powers, and his séances are depicted
as realities. Dumas himself was a firm believer in spiritualism,
and hobnobbed with the American medium Daniel D. Home.</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">VII.</h3>

<p>Cagliostro’s house in the Marais quarter, Paris, still remains—a
memorial in stone of its former master.
In the summer <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
of 1899 the <i>Courrier des Etats-Unis</i>, New York, contained an
interesting article on this mansion. I quote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Cagliostro’s house still stands in Paris. Few alterations have been
made in it since the days of its glories and mysteries; and one may easily
imagine the effect which it produced in the night upon those who gazed upon
its strange pavilions and wide terraces when the lurid lights of the alchemist’s
furnaces streamed through the outer window blinds. The building preserves
its noble lines in spite of modern additions and at the same time has a weird
appearance which produces an almost depressing effect. But this doubtless
comes from the imag­i­na­tion, because the house was not built by Cagliostro;
he simply rented it. When he took up his quarters in it, it was the property
of the Marquise d’Orvillers. Cagliostro made no changes in it, except perhaps
a few temporary interior additions for the machines which he used in
his séances in magic.</p>

<div class="dctr01"><img src="images/i080.jpg"

<span class="smcap">P<b>ARIS</b></span>
<span class="smcap">(P<b>RESENT</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>ONDITION</b>).</span></div></div>

<p>“The plan of the building may well be said to be abnormal. The outer
gate opens upon the Rue Saint Claude at the angle of the Boulevard Beaumarchais.
The courtyard has a morose and solemn aspect. At the end
under a flagged porch there is a stone staircase worn by time, but it still
preserves its old iron railing. On looking at that staircase, one cannot help
thinking of the hosts of beautiful women, attracted by curiosity to the den
of the sorcerer, and terrified at what they imagined they were about to see,
who placed their trembling hands upon that old railing. Here
we can evoke <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
the shade of Mme. de la Motte running up the steps, with her head covered
with a cloak, and the ghosts of the valets of Cardinal de Rohan sleeping in the
driver’s seat of the carriage with a lantern at their feet, while their master, in
company with the Great Kophta, is occupied with necromancy, metallurgy,
cabala, or oneirocritics, which, as everybody knows, constitute the four elementary
divisions of Cagliostro’s art.</p>

<p>“A secret stairway now walled up ran near the large one to the second
story, where its traces are found; and a third stairway, narrow and tortuous,
still exists at the other end of the building on the boulevard side. It is in the
center of the wall, in complete darkness, and leads to the old salons now cut
into apartments, the windows of which look out upon a terrace. Below, with
their mouldering doors, are the carriage house and the stable,—the stable
of Djerid, the splendid black horse of Lorenza Feliciani.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To verify the above statement, I wrote to M. Alfred de
Ricaudy (an authority on archæological matters and editor of
<i>L’Echo du Public</i>, Paris), who responded as follows, Jan. 13,
1900:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The house still exists just as it was in the time of Cagliostro [the exterior].
Upon the boulevard, contiguous to the mansion, there was formerly
the shop of one Camerlingue, a bookseller, now occupied by an upholsterer.
On January 30, 1785, Cagliostro took up his residence in this quaint old house.
It was then No. 30 Rue St. Claude, at the corner of the Boulevard Saint
Antoine, afterwards the Boulevard Beaumarchais. The Marquise d’Orvillers
was the owner of the premises occupied by the thaumaturgist of the eighteenth
century. Her father, M. de Chavigny, captain in the royal navy, had built
this house on ground acquired in 1719 from Mme. de Harlay, who had inherited
it from her father, le Chevalier Boucherat. (See Lefeuve, <i>Old Houses
of Paris</i>, Vol. IV., issue 51, page 24, published by Achille Faure, Paris, 1863.)”</p></blockquote>

<p>Cagliostro’s house is now No. 1, the numbering of the street
having been altered during the reign of Louis Philippe. Says
M. de Ricaudy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The numbering originally began at the Rue Saint Louis, now Rue de
Turenne, in which is situated the church of Saint Denis du Sacrement.
When the houses were re-numbered with reference to the direction of the
current of the Seine (under Louis Philippe), the numbers of the Rue St.
Claude, which is parallel to the river, began at the corner of the boulevard,
and in that way the former number 30 became number 1.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The sombre old mansion has had a peculiar history. Cagliostro
locked the doors of the laboratories and séance-chambre
some time in June, 1786, on the occasion of his exile from France.
All during the great Revolution the house remained closed and intact.
Twenty-four years of undisturbed repose
passed away. The <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
dust settled thick upon everything; spiders built their webs upon
the gilded ceilings of the salons. Finally, in the Napoleonic
year 1810, the doors of the temple of magic and mystery were
unfastened, and the furniture and rare curios, the retorts and
crucibles, belonging to the dead conjurer, were auctioned off.
An idle crowd of curious <i>quid nuncs</i> gathered to witness the sale
and pry about. Says Ricaudy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The household furniture, belongings, etc., of the illustrious adventure
were not sold until five years after his death. The sale took place in the
apartment which he had occupied, and was by order of the municipal government.
An examination revealed many curious acoustical and optical arrangements
constructed in the building by Cagliostro. By the aid of these contrivances
and that of well-trained confederates, he perpetrated many supposedly
magical effects, summoned the shades of the dead,” etc. (<i>See Dictionnaire
de la France</i>. By A. G. de St. Fargeau, Vol. III., page 245. Paris, 1851.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Says Lenôtre:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Since the auctioning of Cagliostro’s effects the gloomy house of the Rue
St. Claude has had no history. Ah, but I am mistaken. In 1855 some repairs
were made. The old carriage door was removed, and the one that took its
place was taken from the ruins of the Temple. There it stands today with
its great bolts and immense locks. The door of the prison of Louis XVI.
closes the house of Cagliostro.”</p></blockquote>

<p>M. de Ricaudy verifies this statement about the door of the
mansion. The student of Parisian archæology will do well to
consult M. de Ricaudy, as well as M. Labreton, 93 Boulevard
Beaumarchais, who possesses forty volumes relating to the history
of the Marais Quarter. Last but not least is the indefatigable
student of ancient landmarks of Paris, M. G. Lenôtre,
author of <i>Paris révolutionnaire, vieilles maisons, vieux papiers,
1re série</i>.</p>

<p>My friend, M. Félicien Trewey, who visited the place in the
summer of 1901, at my request, reported to me that it had been
converted into a commercial establishment. The salons were
cut up into small apartments. The laboratories and the <i>chambre
égyptienne</i> where the great sorcerer held his séances were no
more. A grocer, a feather curler, and a manufacturer of cardboard
boxes occupied the building, oblivious of the fact that the
world-renowned Cagliostro once lived there, plying his trade
of sorcerer, mesmerist, physician, and mason, like a true <i>chevalier
d’industrie</i>. Alas! the history of these
old mansions! They <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span>
have their days of splendid prosperity, followed by shabby gentility
and finally by sordid decay,—battered, blear-eyed, and repulsive
looking.</p>

<p>According to Henri d’Almeras (<i>Cagliostro, et la franc-maconnerie
et l’occultisme au XVIIIe siècle</i>), Cagliostro’s apartment
on the second floor of the house was occupied in the year
1904 by a watchmaker. Two famous watchmakers became conjurers,
one after having read an old book on natural magic, the
other after having seen a performance of the Davenport Brothers.
I allude to Robert-Houdin and Jno. Nevil Maskelyne. Watchmaking
leads naturally to the construction of automata and magical
illusions. The young horologist of the Rue Saint Claude has
every excuse to become a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur. He works in an
atmosphere of necromancy in that old house haunted by its memories
of the past. If this does not influence him to enter the
magic circle, nothing else will.</p>

<p>People pass and repass this ghost-house of the Rue Saint
Claude every day, but not one in a hundred knows that the great
enchanter once resided there and held high court. If those dumb
walls could but speak, what fascinating stories of super­sti­tion
and folly they might unfold to our wondering ears! Yes, in this
ancient house, dating back to pre-Revolutionary Paris, to the
old régime, the great necromancer known as Cagliostro lived
in the zenith of his fame. In these golden years of his life, was
he never haunted by disturbing visions of the dungeons of the
Holy Inquisition, yawning to receive him? Ah, who can tell?
Thanks to the gossipy memoir writers of the period, I am able
to give a pen portrait, composite, if you will, of some of the
scenes that were enacted in the antiquated mansion.</p>

<p>It is night. The lanterns swung in the streets of old Paris
glimmer fitfully. Silence broods over the city with shadowy
wings. No sound is heard save the clank of the patrol on its
rounds. The Rue Saint Claude, however, is all bustle and confusion.
A grand “soirée magique” is being held at the house of
Monsieur le Comte de Cagliostro. Heavy old-fashioned carriages
stand in front of the door, with coachmen lolling sleepily
on the boxes, and linkboys playing rude games with each other
in the kennel. A rumble in the street—ha, there,
lackeys! out of <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
the way! Here comes the coach of my Lord Cardinal, Prince
Louis de Rohan. There is a flash of torches. Servants in gorgeous
liveries of red and gold, with powdered wigs, open the
door of the vehicle, and let down the steps with a crash. Monseigneur
le Cardinal, celebrant of the mass in the royal palace
at Versailles, man of pleasure and alchemist, descends. He is
enveloped in a dark cloak, as if to court disguise, but it is only
a polite pretense. He enters the mansion of his bosom friend,
Cagliostro the magician. Within, all is a blaze of light. A life-size
bust of the divine Cagliostro ornaments the foyer. Visitors
are received in a handsomely furnished apartment on the second
floor. Beyond that is the séance-room, a mysterious chamber
hung with somber drapery. Wax candles in tall silver sconces,
arranged about the place in mystic pentagons and triangles,
illuminate the scene.</p>

<p>In the center of the room is a table with a black cloth, on
which are embroidered in red the symbols of the highest degree
of the Rosicrucians. Upon this strange shekinah is placed the
cabalistic apparatus of the necromancer—odd little Egyptian
figures of Isis, Osiris, vials of lustral waters, and a large globe
full of clarified water. It is all very uncanny. Presently the
guests are seated in a circle about the altar, and form a magnetic
chain. As the old chroniclers phrase it, to them enters Cagliostro,
the Grand Kophta, the man who has lived thousands of
years, habited in gorgeous robes like the arch-hierophant of an
ancient Egyptian temple. The clairvoyant is now brought in,
a child of angelic purity, who was born under a certain constellation,
of delicate nerves, great sensitiveness, and, withal, blue
eyes. She is bidden to kneel before the globe, and relate what
she sees therein. Cagliostro makes passes over her, and commands
the genii to enter the water. The very soul of the seeress
is penetrated with the magnetic aura emanating from the magician.
She becomes convulsed, and declares that she sees events
taking place that very moment at the court of Versailles, at
Vienna, at Rome.</p>

<p>Every one present is transported with joy. Monseigneur le
Cardinal de Rohan is charmed, delighted, and lauds the necromancer
to the skies. How weird
and wonderful! Albertus <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span>
Magnus, Nostradamus and Appolonius of Tyana are not to be
compared with the all-powerful Cagliostro. Truly he is the
descendant of the Egyptian thaumaturgists.</p>

<p>The séance is followed by a banquet. Rose-leaves are showered
over the guests from the gilded ceiling, perfumed water
plashes in the fountains, and a hidden orchestra of violins, flutes
and harps plays soft melodies. The scene reminds one of the
splendid feasts of the Roman voluptuaries in the decadent
days of the empire. The lovely Lorenza Feliciani, wife
of the enchanter, discourses learnedly of sylphs, salamanders
and gnomes, in the jargon of the Rosicrucians. The Cardinal,
his veins on fire with love and champagne, gazes amorously
at her. But he is thinking all the while of the aristocratic
Marie Antoinette, who treats him with such cruel disdain. But
Cagliostro has promised to win the Queen for him, to melt her
icy heart with love-philters and magical talismans. Let him but
possess his soul in patience a little while. All will be well. Aye,
indeed, well enough to land the haughty prelate in the Bastille,
and start the magician on that downward path to the Inquisition
at Rome.</p>

<p>The night wanes. The lights of the banqueting-hall burn
lower and lower. Finally the <i>grandes dames</i> and the <i>seigneurs</i>
take their departure. When the last carriage has rolled away
into the darkness, Cagliostro and his wife yawn wearily, and
retire to their respective sleeping-apartments. The augurs of
Rome, says a Latin poet, could not look at each other without
laughing. Cagliostro and Lorenza in bidding each other goodnight
exchange smiles of incalculable cunning. The sphinx
masks have dropped from their faces, and they know each other
to be—charlatans and impostors, preying upon a super­sti­tious
society. The magician is alone. He places his wax light upon
an escritoire, and throws himself into an arm-chair before the
great fireplace, carved and gilded with many a grotesque image.
The flames of the blazing logs weave all sorts of fantastic forms
on floor and ceiling. The wind without howls in the chimney
like a lost spirit. The figures embroidered on the tapestry assume
monstrous shapes of evil portent—alguazils, cowled inquisitors,
and jailers with rusty
keys and chains. <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span></p>

<p>But the magician sees nothing of it all, hears not the warning
cry of the wind: he is thinking of his newly hatched lodges of
Egyptian occultism, and the golden louis d’or to be conjured
out of the strong-boxes of
his Parisian dupes.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">The French Revolution drew crowds of adventurers to Paris,
their brains buzzing with the wildest schemes—political, social,
and scientific—which they endeavored to exploit. Among the
inventors was a Belgian optician, Etienne-Gaspard Robertson,
born at Liège, in 1763, where for many years he had been a
professor of physics. He addressed a memorial in the year 1794
to the Government proposing to construct gigantic burning
glasses <i>à la</i> Archimedes, to set fire to the English fleets, at that
period blockading the French seaports. A commission composed
of Monge, Lefevre, Gineau and Guyton de Morveau was appointed
to investigate the matter, but nothing came of it.</p>

<p>Failing to accomplish his scheme, Robertson turned his attention
to other methods of money-making. Four years passed away.
Having a decided <i>penchant</i> for magic illusions, etc., he set about
constructing a ghost-making apparatus. The “Red Terror” was
a thing of the past, and people had begun to pluck up courage
and seek amusements. Rid to a great extent, of his rival, La
Guillotine—the most famous of “ghost-making machines”—Robertson
set up his phan­tas­ma­goria at the Pavilion de l’Echiquier,
and flooded the city with circulars describing his exhibition.
Poultier, a journalist and one of the Representatives of the
People, wrote an amusing account of the entertainment in the
<i>L’Ami des Lois</i>, 1798.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a>
He says: <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span></p>

<p>“A decemvir of the Republic has said that the dead return
no more, but go to Robertson’s exhibition and you will soon
be convinced of the contrary, for you will see the dead returning
to life in crowds. Robertson calls forth phantoms, and commands
legions of spectres. In a well-lighted apartment in the
Pavilion l’Echiquier I found myself seated a few evenings since,
with sixty or seventy people. At seven o’clock a pale, thin man
entered the room where we were sitting, and having extinguished
the candles he said: ‘Citizens, I am not one of those adventurers
and impudent swindlers who promise more than they can perform.
I have assured the public in the <i>Journal de Paris</i> that I
can bring the dead to life, and I shall do so. Those of the company
who desire to see the apparitions of those who were dear
to them, but who have passed away from this life by sickness or
otherwise, have only to speak; and I shall obey their commands.’
There was a moment’s silence, and a haggard-looking man, with
dishevelled hair and sorrowful eyes, rose in the midst of the
assemblage and exclaimed, ‘As I have been unable in an official
journal to re-establish the worship of Marat, I should at least
be glad to see his shadow.’ Robertson
immediately threw upon <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
a brazier containing lighted coals, two glasses of blood, a bottle
of vitriol, a few drops of aquafortis, and two numbers of the
<i>Journal des Hommes Libres</i>, and there instantly appeared in the
midst of the smoke caused by the burning of these substances, a
hideous livid phantom armed with a dagger and wearing a red
cap of liberty. The man at whose wish the phantom had been
evoked seemed to recognize Marat, and rushed forward to embrace
the vision, but the ghost made a frightful grimace and
disappeared. A young man next asked to see the phantom of a
young lady whom he had tenderly loved, and
whose portrait he <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
showed to the worker of all these marvels. Robertson threw
upon the brazier a few sparrow’s feathers, a grain or two of
phosphorus, and a dozen butterflies. A beautiful woman with
her bosom uncovered and her hair floating about her, soon
appeared, and smiled on the young man with most tender regard
and sorrow. A grave looking individual sitting close by me
suddenly exclaimed, ‘Heavens! it’s my wife come to life again,’
and he rushed from the room, apparently fearing that what he
saw was not a phantom.”</p>

Du 8 germinal au VI—28 Mars, 1798.</p></div>

<p>One evening one of the audience, avowing himself to be a
Royalist, called for the shade of the martyred king, Louis XVI.
Here was a dilemma for citizen Robertson. Had he complied
with the request and evoked the royal ghost, prison and possibly
the guillotine would have been his fate.</p>

<p>But the magician was foxy. He suspected a trap on the part
of a police agent in disguise, who had a spite against him. He
replied as follows: “Citizens, I once had a recipe for bringing
dead kings to life, but that was before the 18th Fructidor, when
the Republic declared royalty abolished forever. On that glorious
day I lost my magic formula, and fear that I shall never
recover it again.”</p>

<p>In spite of Robertson’s clever retort, the affair created such
a sensation that on the following day, the police prohibited the
exhibitions, and placed seals on the optician’s boxes and papers.
However, the ban was soon lifted, and the performances allowed
to continue. Lucky Robertson! The advertisement filled his
coffers to overflowing. People struggled to gain admission to
the wonderful phan­tas­ma­goria.</p>

<p>Finding the Pavilion too small to accommodate the crowds,
the magician moved his show to an abandoned chapel of the
Capuchin Convent, near the Place Vendôme. This ancient place
of worship was located in the middle of a vast cloister crowded
with tombs and funeral tablets.</p>

<p>A more gruesome spot could not have been selected. The
Chapel was draped in black. From the ceiling was suspended a
sepulchral lamp, in which alcohol and salt were burned, giving
forth a ghastly light which made the faces
of the spectators <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
resemble those of corpses. Robertson, habited in black, made
his appearance, and harangued his audience on ghosts, witches,
sorcery, and magic. Finally the lamp was extinguished and the
apartment plunged in Plutonian darkness. A storm of wind and
rain, thunder and lightning, interspersed with the tolling of a
church bell, followed, and after this the solemn strains of a far-off
organ were heard. At the evocation of the conjurer, phantoms
of Voltaire, Mirabeau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Robespierre,
Danton, and Marat appeared and faded away again “into thin
air.” The ghost of Robespierre was shown rising from a tomb.
A flash of lightning, vivid and terrible, would strike the phantom,
whereupon it would sink down into the ground and vanish.</p>

<p>People were often carried away fainting from the exhibition.
It was truly awe inspiring and perfect in <i>mise en scène</i>.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the séance, Robertson used to remark: “I
have shown you, citizens, every species of phantom, and there is
but one more truly terrible spectre—the fate which is reserved
for us all. Behold!” In an instant there stood in the center of
the room a skeleton armed with a scythe. It grew to a colossal
height and gradually faded away.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn18" id="fnanc18">18</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc18" id="fn18">18</a>
For a romance embracing the subject of phan­tas­ma­goria
see the poet Schiller’s <i>Ghost-Seer</i>. (Bohn Library.)</p></div>

<p>Sir David Brewster, in his work on natural magic, has the
following to say about concave mirrors and the art of phan­tas­ma­goria:
“Concave mirrors are distinguished by their property
of forming in front of them, and in the air, inverted images of
erect objects, or erect images of inverted objects, placed at some
distance beyond their principal focus. If a fine transparent cloud
of blue smoke is raised, by means of a chafing dish, around the
focus of a large concave mirror, the image of any highly illuminated
object will be depicted in the middle of it, with great beauty.
A skull concealed from the observer is sometimes used to surprise
the ignorant; and when a dish of fruit has been depicted
in a similar manner, a spectator, stretching out his hand to seize
it, is met with the image of a drawn dagger which has been
quickly substituted for the fruit at the other conjugate focus of
the mirror.” <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span></p>

<p>Thoroughly conversant with the science of optics, it is more
than probable that Robertson made use of large concave mirrors
to project inverted phantoms of living persons in the air, with
convex lenses to restore the ghosts to an upright position. If
he merely used painted images, which is the more likely, then he
had resort to the phantasmagoric magic lantern, rolling upon
a small track. Pushing this contrivance backwards and forwards
caused the images to lessen or increase, to recede or advance.</p>

<p>Robertson realized quite a snug fortune out of his ghost exhibition
and other inventions. His automaton speaking figure,
called <i>le phonorganon</i>, uttered two hundred words of the French
language. Another interesting piece of mechanism was his
Trumpeter. These two machines formed part of a beautiful
<i>Cabinet de Physique</i> in his house, the Hotel d’ Yorck, Boulevard
Montmartre, No. 12 Paris. He has left some entertaining
memoirs, entitled <i>Mémoires récréatifs et anecdotifs</i> (1830–1834),
copies of which are exceedingly rare. He was a great aeronaut
and invented the parachute which has been wrongly attributed
to Garnerin.</p>

<p>Robertson, as <i>Commandant des Aerostiers</i>, served in the
French army, and rendered valuable service with his balloons in
observing the movements of the enemy in the campaigns in
Belgium and Holland, under General Jourdain. In the year 1804
he wrote a treatise on ballooning, entitled, <i>La Minerve, vaisseau
Aérien destiné aux découvertes, et proposé, à toutes les Académies
de l’Europe</i>, published at Vienna. He died at Batignolles
(Paris) in 1837.</p>

<p>In his memoirs, Robertson describes a species of optical toy
called the Phantascope, for producing illusions on a small scale.
This may give a clue to his spectres of the Capuchin Convent. He
also offers an explanation of Nostradamus’ famous feat of conjuring
up the likeness of Francis I. in a magic mirror, for the
edification of the beautiful Marie de Médici.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">II.</h3>

<p>We now come to the greatest of all ghost-shows, that of the
Polytechnic Institute, London. In the year
1863 letters patent <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span>
were granted to Professor John Henry Pepper, professor of
chemistry in the London Polytechnic Institute, and Henry Dircks,
civil engineer, for a device “for projecting images of living persons
in the air.” Here were no concave mirrors, no magic lanterns,
simply a large sheet of unsilvered glass. The effect is
founded on a well-known optical illusion. “In the evening carry
a lighted candle to the window and you will see reflected in the
pane, not only the image of the candle, but that of your hand
and face as well. A sheet of glass, inclined at a certain angle,
is placed on a stage between the actors and spectators. Beneath
the stage and just in front of the glass, is a person robed in a
white shroud, and illuminated by the brilliant rays of the electric
or the oxy-hydrogen light. The image of the actor who plays
the part of spectre, being reflected by the glass, becomes visible
to the spectators, and stands, apparently, just as far behind the
glass as its prototype is placed in front of it. This image is only
visible to the audience. The actor who is on the stage sees
nothing of it, and in order that he may not strike at random in
his attacks on the spectre, it is necessary to mark beforehand on
the boards the particular spot at which, to the eyes of the audience,
the phantom will appear. Care must be taken to have the theatre
darkened and the stage very dimly lighted.”</p>

<p>At the Polytechnic Institute the ghost was admirably produced.
The stage represented the room of a mediaeval student
who was engaged in burning the midnight oil. Looking up
from his black-letter tome he beheld the apparition of a skeleton.
Resenting the intrusion he arose from his chair, seized a sword
which was ready to his hand, and aimed a blow at the figure,
which vanished, only to return again and again.</p>

<p>The assistant who manipulated the spectre wore a cover of
black velvet. He held the real skeleton in his arms, and made
the fleshless bones assume the most grotesque attitudes. He had
evidently studied Holbein’s “Dance of Death.” The lower part
of the skeleton, from the pelvis downward, was dressed in white
linen, presumably a shroud. To the audience the figure seemed
to vanish and reappear
through the floor. <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span></p>

<p>This ghost-making apparatus has been used with splendid
success in the dramatizations of Dickens’ <i>Christmas Carol</i> and
<i>Haunted Man</i>; Bulwer’s <i>Strange Story</i>; and Alexander Dumas’
<i>Corsican Brothers</i>.</p>

<p>“In the course of the same year (1863),” says Robert-Houdin
in his <i>Les Secrets de la pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion et de la magie</i>, “M.
Hostein, manager of the Imperial Châtelet Theatre, purchased<a class="afnanc" href="#fn19" id="fnanc19">19</a>
from M. Pepper the secret of the ‘Ghost,’ in order to introduce
it into a drama entitled <i>Le Secret de Miss Aurore</i> [a French
adaptation of “Aurora Floyd”]. M. Hostein spared no expense
in order to ensure the success of the illusion. Three enormous
sheets of unsilvered glass, each five yards square, were placed side
by side, and presented an ample surface for the reflection of the
ghost-actor and his movements. Two Drummond lights (oxy-hydrogen)
were used for the purpose of the trick.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc19" id="fn19">19</a>
He paid 20,000 francs for the invention.</p></div>

<p>“But before the trick was in working order at its new destination,
several of the Parisian theatres, in the face of letters
patent duly granted to M. Pepper, had already advertised performances
wherein it was included.</p>

<p>“M. Hostein had no means of preventing the piracy; unluckily
for himself, and still more so for the inventor, the plagiarists
had discovered among the French official records a patent
taken out, ten years before, by a person named Séguin for a
toy called the <i>Polyoscope</i>, which was founded on the same principle
as the ghost illusion.”</p>

<p>Professor Pepper claims to have been totally unaware of
the existence of M. Séguin’s Polyoscope. In his <i>True History
of the Ghost</i>, Pepper describes the toy as follows:</p>

<p>“It consisted of a box with a small sheet of glass placed at
an angle of forty-five degrees, and it reflected a concealed table,
with plastic figures, the spectres of which appeared behind the
glass, and which young people who possessed the toy invited
their companions to take out of the box, when they melted away,
as it were, in their hands and disappeared.”</p>

<p>In France, at that time, all improvements on a patent fell
to the original patentee, and Pepper found
himself out-of-court. <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span></p>

<p>The conjurer Robin claims, on very good authority, to have
been the original inventor of the ghost illusion. He writes
as follows:</p>

<p>“I first had the idea of producing the apparitions in 1845.
Meeting innumerable difficulties in carrying out my invention I
was obliged to wait until 1847 before reaching a satisfactory
result. In that year I was able to exhibit the ‘spectres’ to the
public in the theatres of Lyons and Saint Etienne under the name
of ‘The living phan­tas­ma­goria.’ To my great astonishment I
produced little effect. The apparitions still were in want of
certain improvements which I have since added. After succeeding
in perfecting them I met with great success in exhibiting
them in Venice, Rome, Munich, Vienna and Brussels, but as my
experiments were very costly I was obliged to lay them aside
for some time.”</p>

<p>He further declares that M. Séguin, who had been employed
by him to paint phantasmagoric figures, had based his toy, the
Polyoscope, upon the principle of his (Robin’s) spectres. Robin
was one of the managers who brought out the illusion in Paris,
despite the protests of M. Hostein. He opposed Hostein with
the patent of the Polyoscope and some of his old theatre posters
of the year 1847, advertising the “living phan­tas­ma­goria.”</p>

<p>Houdin is rather severe on M. Robin when he classes him
among the plagiarists and pirates. But the two conjurers were
great rivals. M. Caroly, editor of the <i>Illusioniste</i>, in an article
on Robin, suggests that perhaps Pepper had seen and examined
a Polyoscope, and built upon it the theatrical illusion of the ghost.
My personal belief is that Professor Pepper was ignorant of
the existence of the toy as well as of Robin’s former exhibitions
of phan­tas­ma­goria, and independently thought out the ghost
illusion. This frequently happens among inventors, as every
one knows, who has dealings with the U. S. Patent Office.</p>

<p>In the year 1868, there was exhibited in Paris, at the Ambigu
Theatre, the melodrama of “La Czarine,” founded on Robert-Houdin’s
story of Kempelen’s Automaton Chess Player. In this
play was a remarkable use of the “ghost illusion,” arranged by
Houdin, as well as a chess-playing automaton.
I quote as <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
follows from Houdin’s <i>Les Secrets de la pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion et de la
magie</i>, Chapter VI: “My collaborators, Messrs. Adenis and
Gastineau, had asked me to arrange a ‘ghost effect’ for the last
act. I had recourse to the ‘ghost illusion’, but I presented it
in such guise as to give it a completely novel character, as the
reader will be enabled to judge from the following description:
The scene is laid in Russia, in the reign of Catherine II. In
the last act, an individual named Pougatcheff, who, on the
strength of a personal likeness to Peter III, attempts to pass
himself off as the deceased monarch, is endeavoring to incite the
Russian populace to dethrone Catherine. A learned man, M. de
Kempelen, who is devoted to the Czarina, succeeds, by the aid of
scientific expedients, in neutralizing the villainous designs of the
sham prince.</p>

<p>“The scene is a savage glen, behind which is seen a background
of rugged rocks. Pougatcheff appears, surrounded by a
crowd of noisy adherents. M. de Kempelen comes forward, denounces
the impostor, and declares that, to complete his confusion,
he will call up the spirit of the genuine Peter III. At his command
a sarcophagus appears from the solid rock; it stands
upright on end. The lid opens, and exhibits a corpse covered
with a winding sheet. The tomb falls to the ground, but the
phantom remains erect. The sham Czar, though a good deal
frightened, makes a pretence of defying the apparition, which
he treats as a mere illusion. But the upper part of the winding
sheet falls aside, and reveals the livid and moulding features of
the late sovereign. Pougatcheff, thinking that he can hardly
be worsted in a fight with a corpse, draws his sword, and with
one blow cuts off its head, which falls noisily to the ground;
but at the very same moment the living head of Peter III
appears on the ghostly shoulders. Pougatcheff, driven to frenzy
by these successive apparitions, makes at the figure, seizes it
by its garments, and thrusts it violently back into the tomb. But
the head remains suspended in space, rolling its eyes in a threatening
manner, and appearing to offer defiance to its persecutor.
The frenzy of Pougatcheff reaches its culminating point. Grasping
his sword with both hands, he tries to cleave
in twain the <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
head of his mysterious adversary; but his blade only passes
through a shadowy being, who laughs to scorn his impotent
rage. Again he raises his sword, but at the same moment the
body of Peter III, in full imperial costume, and adorned with
all the insignia of his rank, becomes visible beneath the head.
The re-animate Czar hurls the impostor violently back, exclaiming,
in a voice of thunder. ‘Hold sacrilegious wretch!’ Pougatcheff,
terror-stricken, and overwhelmed with confusion, confesses
his imposture, and the phantom vanishes.</p>

<p>“The stage arrangements to produce these effects are as
follows: An actor, robed in the brilliant costume of Peter III,
reclines against the sloped support beneath the stage. His body
is covered with a wrapper of black velvet, which is designed to
prevent, until the proper moment, any reflection in the glass.
His head alone is uncovered, and ready to be reflected in the
glass so soon as the rays of the electric light shall be directed
upon it.</p>

<p>“The phantom which originally comes out of the sarcophagus
is a dummy, whose head is modeled from that of the actor who
plays the part of Czar. This head is made readily detachable
from the body.</p>

<p>“Everything is placed and arranged in such manner that the
dummy image of Peter III shall precisely correspond in position
with the person of the actor who plays the part of ghost.</p>

<p>“At the same moment that the head of the former falls to
the ground, the electric light is gradually made to shine on the
head of the actor who plays the part of Peter III, which being
reflected in the glass, appears to shape itself on the body of the
dummy ghost. After this latter is hurled to the ground, the veil
which hides the body of the actor Czar is quickly and completely
drawn away, and the sudden flood of the electric light reflects
his whole body where his head alone was previously visible.”</p>

<p>As a clever producer of the living and impalpable spectres,
Robin had no equal. I will describe two of his effects. The
curtain rose, showing a cemetery with tombstones and cenotaphs.
It was midnight. A lover entered and stood weeping over the
tomb of his dead fiancée. Suddenly she
appeared before him <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
arrayed in a winding sheet which she threw aside, revealing herself
in the dress of a bride. He endeavored to embrace her.
His arms passed unimpeded through the spectre. Gradually
the vision melted away, leaving him grieving and desolate.</p>

<p>The impression produced by this illusion was profound and
terrifying. Amid cries of astonishment and fright resounding
through the hall, many women fainted or made their escape.</p>

<span class="smcap">G<b>HOST</b>-I<b>LLUSION.</b></span></div></div>

<p>Robin devised another scene which he called “The Demon
of Paganini.” An actor made up to resemble the famous violin
virtuoso, Paganini, tall, gaunt, with flowing locks, and dressed in
shabby black, was seen reclining upon a couch. A devil, habited
in green and red, and armed with a violin, made its appearance
and clambered upon the sleeper, installing himself comfortably
on the violinist’s stomach. Then the demon gave himself up
to a violin solo which was not in the least interrupted by the
frantic gestures of the nightmare ridden sufferer, whose hands
attempted in vain to seize the weird violin and
bow. The demon, <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
sometimes sitting, sometimes kneeling on the body of his victim,
continued his musical selection.</p>

<p>The Demon of Paganini was mounted on a special support
by which he could be elevated and depressed at pleasure. The
violinist, who was the real player, stood below the stage, but in
the shade, at one side of the electric lamp which illuminated the
demon. The sound issued from the opening in front of the glass.
The glass used by Robin measured 5 by 4 meters, in a single
piece. It was placed with great care, for the least deviation would
be followed by a displacement of the image.</p>

<p>It should be remarked that Robin’s auditorium comprised
only a sloping parterre surrounded by a range of small boxes.
There was no gallery. The spectators, consequently, were not
elevated sufficiently to perceive the opening in the stage.</p>

<p>When, in 1866, Robin’s Spectres were taken to a large theatre
in Paris, the Châtelet, he was obliged to devise a different
arrangement, for the spectators in the galleries
above were able <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
to see, at the same time, both the actor and his reflection. Robin
had been obliged to place his actor on a lower level because he
had no room at the side of his little stage. At the Châtelet, however,
space permitted a much more convenient arrangement, for
it allowed the actor, who furnished the reflection, to move about
freely on a horizontal plane. The glass was placed vertically
and formed, on the plane, an angle of about 45° with the longitudinal
axis of the theatre. The actor was hidden behind a
wing; his reflection appeared in the center of the stage toward
the back-drop; visible, nevertheless, to all the spectators. His
field of movement, necessarily restricted, was marked out in
advance upon the floor.</p>

<p>Robin was able to preserve for a considerable time the secret
of the ghost illusion; just enough to pique the curiosity of the
public. It was guessed at last that he made use of unsilvered
glass. The fact became known and several wags proved the
presence of the glass by throwing inoffensive paper balls which
struck the obstacle and fell, arrested in their flight. Robin was
greatly vexed at these occurrences but the trick was none the less
exposed.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>Pepper eventually brought out a new illusion called “Me­tem­psy­cho­sis,”
the joint inven­tion of himself and a Mr. Walker. It
is a very star­tling optical ef­fect, and is thus described by me in my
American edition of Stanyon’s <i>Magic</i>: “One of the cleverest
illusions performed with the aid of mirrors is that known as the
‘Blue Room’, which has been exhibited in this country by Kellar.
It was patented in the United States by the inventors. The object
of the apparatus is to render an actor, or some inanimate thing,
such as a chair, table, suit of armor, etc., visible or invisible at
will. ‘It is also designed,’ says the spec­i­fi­ca­tion in the patent
office, ‘to sub­sti­tute for an object in sight of the audience the
image of another similar object hidden from direct vision without
the audience being aware that any such sub­sti­tu­tion has been
made.’ For this purpose employ a large mirror—either an ordinary
mirror or for some purposes, by preference,
a large sheet <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
of plate-glass—which is transparent at one end and more and
more densely silvered in passing from this toward the other end.
Mount this mirror or plate so that it can, at pleasure, be placed
diagonally across the stage or platform. As it advances, the
glass obscures the view of the actor or object in front of which
it passes, and substitutes the reflection of an object in front of the
glass, but suitably concealed from the direct view of the audience.</p>

<p>“When the two objects or sets of objects thus successively
presented to the view are properly placed and sufficiently alike,
the audience will be unaware that any change has been made. In
some cases, in place of a single sheet of glass, two or more sheets
may be employed.”</p>

<p>By consulting Fig. 1, the reader will understand the construction
of the illusion, one of the best in the
repertoire of the <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
conjurer. The shaded drawing in the left upper part, represents a
portion of the mirror, designed to show its graduated opacity.</p>

<p>“<i>a</i> is a stage. It may be in a lecture-room or theatre. <i>bb</i>,
the seats for the audience in front of the stage. <i>cc</i> is a small
room—eight or ten feet square and eight high will often be sufficiently
large; but it may be of any size. It may advantageously
be raised and approached by two or three steps from the stage <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>d</i> is a vertical mirror, passing diagonally across the chamber
<i>c</i> and dividing it into two parts, which are exact counterparts the
one of the other. The mirror <i>d</i> is so mounted that it can be
rapidly and noiselessly moved diagonally across the chamber in
the path represented by the dotted line
<span class="nowrap"><i>d</i>&#xa0;<sup>1</sup>,</span> and be withdrawn
whenever desired. This can conveniently be done by running it
in guides and upon rollers to and from a position where it is
hidden by a screen, <i>e</i>, which limits the view of the audience in
this direction.</p>

<p>“In consequence of the exact correspondence of the two parts
of the chamber <i>c</i>, that in front and that behind the mirror, the
audience will observe no change in appearance when the mirror
is passed across.</p>

<p>“The front of the chamber is partially closed at <i>cx</i> by a shield
or short partition-wall, either permanently or whenever required.
This is done in order to hide from direct view any object which
may be at or about the position
<span class="nowrap"><i>c</i>&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>.</span></p>

<p>“The illusions may be performed in various ways—as,
for example, an object may, in the sight of the
audience, be passed from the stage to the position
<span class="nowrap"><i>c</i>&#x202f;<sup>2</sup>,</span>
near the rear short wall or counterpart shield <i>f</i>,
diagonally opposite to and corresponding with the front
corner shield <i>cx</i>, and there be changed for some
other. This is done by providing beforehand a dummy at
<span class="nowrap"><i>c</i>&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>,</span>
closely resembling the object at <span
class="nowrap"><i>c</i>&#x202f;<sup>2</sup>.</span> Then when
the object is in its place, the mirror is passed across
without causing any apparent change. The object, when
hidden, is changed for another object externally resembling
the first, the mirror is withdrawn, and the audience
may then be shown in any convenient way that the object
now before them differs from that which their eyesight
would lead them to suppose it to be. <span class="xxpn"
id="p103">{103}</span></p>

<p>“We prefer, in many cases, not to use an ordinary mirror,
<i>d</i>, but one of graduated opacity. This may be produced by removing
the silvering from the glass in lines; or, if the glass be silvered
by chemical deposition, causing the silver to be deposited upon it
in lines, somewhat as represented in Fig. 1. Near one side of the
glass the lines are made fine and open, and progressively in passing
toward the other side they become bolder and closer until a
completely-silvered surface is reached. Other means for obtaining
a graduated opacity and reflecting power may be resorted to.</p>

<p>“By passing such a graduated mirror between the object at
<span class="nowrap"><i>c</i>&#x202f;<sup>2</sup></span>
and the audience, the object may be made to fade from the sight,
or gradually to resolve itself into another form.”</p>

<p>Hopkins in his fine work on <i>Magic, stage illusions, etc.</i>, to
which I contributed the Introduction and other chapters, thus
describes one of the many effects which can be produced by the
Blue Room apparatus. The curtain rises, showing “the stage set
as an artist’s studio. Through the centre of the rear drop scene
is seen a small chamber in which is a suit of armor standing upright.
The floor of this apartment is raised above the level of the
stage and is approached by a short flight of steps. When the curtain
is raised a servant makes his appearance and begins to dust
and clean the apartments. He finally comes to the suit of armor,
taking it apart, cleans and dusts it, and finally reunites it. No
sooner is the armor perfectly articulated than the soulless mailed
figure deals the servant a blow. The domestic, with a cry of
fear, drops his duster, flies down the steps into the large room,
the suit of armor pursuing him, wrestling with him, and kicking
him all over the stage. When the armor considers that it has
punished the servant sufficiently, it returns to its original position
in the small chamber, just as the master of the house enters,
brought there by the noise and cries of the servant, from whom he
demands an explanation of the commotion. Upon being told, he
derides the servant’s fear, and, to prove that he was mistaken,
takes the suit of armor apart, throwing it piece by piece upon
the floor.”</p>

<p>It is needless, perhaps, to explain that the armor which
becomes endowed with life has a man inside of
it. When the <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span>
curtain rises a suit of armor is seen in the Blue Room, at H, (Fig.
2). At I is a second suit, concealed behind the proscenium. It
is the duplicate of the visible one. When the mirror is shoved
diagonally across the room, the armor at H becomes invisible, but
the mirror reflects the armor concealed at I, making it appear to
the spectators that the suit at H is still in position. An actor
dressed in armor now enters behind the mirror, removes the suit
of armor at H, and assumes its place. When the mirror is again
withdrawn, the armor at H becomes endowed with life. Again
the mirror is shoved across the apartment, and the actor replaces
the original suit of armor at H. It is this latter suit which
the master of the house takes to pieces and casts upon the floor,
in order to quiet the fears of the servant. This most ingenious
apparatus is capable of many novel effects. Those who have
witnessed Professor Kellar’s performance will bear witness to
the statement. When the illusion was first produced in England
a sketch entitled Curried Prawns was written for it by the
famous comic author, Burnand, editor of <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>An old gentleman, after having partaken freely of a dish
of curried prawns, washed down by copious libations of wine,
retires to bed, and very naturally “sees things.” Who would not
under such circumstances? He has a dreadful nightmare, during
which ghosts, goblins, vampires and witches visit him. The
effects are produced by the mirror.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>When I was searching among the books of the Bibliothèque
Nationale, Paris, for material concerning Robertson and others,
a very remarkable ghost show was all the rage in the Montmartre
Quarter of the city, based on the Pepper illusion. I will endeavor
to describe it. It was held at the <i>Cabaret du Néant</i>, or Tavern
of the Dead. “Anything for a new sensation” is the motto of
the Boulevardier. Death is no laughing matter, but the gay
Parisian is ready to mock even at the Grim Tyrant, hence the
vogue of the Tavern of the Dead. I went to this lugubrious
cabaret in company with a student of medicine.
He seemed to <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
think the whole affair a huge joke, but then he was a hair-brained,
thoughtless young fellow.</p>

<p>The Inn of Death was located in the Rue Cujas, near by
the Rue Champollion. Over its grim black-painted portal burned
an ashy blue and brimstone flame. It seemed like entering a charnel
house. My student friend led the way down a gloomy passage
into a room hung with funeral cloth. Coffins served as tables,
and upon each was placed a lighted taper. From the ceiling
hung a grewsome-looking chandelier, known as “Robert Macaire’s
chandelier.” It was formed of skulls and bones. In the
skulls were placed lights. The waiters of the cabaret were garbed
like <i>croque-morts</i> (undertaker’s men). In sepulchral tones one
of these gloomy-looking garçons, a trifle more cadaverous than
his confrères, sidled up to us like a huge black raven and croaked
out, “Name your poison, gentlemen. We have on tap distilled
grave-worms, deadly microbes, the bacteria of all diseases under
the sun,” etc. Whatever one called for in this undertaking establishment,
the result was the same—beer of doubtful quality.
After drinking a bock we descended a flight of grimy stairs to
another apartment which was hung with black cloth, ornamented
with white tears, like the decorations furnished by the <i>Pompes
Funèbres</i> (Undertakers’ Trust) of Paris, on state occasions.
Here we were solemnly greeted by a couple of quasi Capuchin
monks with the words: “<i>Voilà des Machabées!</i>” We seated
ourselves on a wooden bench and waited for the séance to begin.
Among the spectators were several students and their grisettes,
a little piou-piou (soldier), and a fat gentleman with a waxed
moustache and imperial, who might have been a <i>chef de cuisine</i>
in disguise or a member of the <i>Académie Française</i>. A curtain
at one end of the room was pulled aside, revealing a stage set
to represent a mouldy crypt, in the center of which stood upright
an empty coffin. A volunteer being called for, my medical friend
agreed to stand in the grim box for the dead. One of the
monks wrapped about the young man’s body a winding sheet.
A strong light was turned on him. Presently a deathly pallor
overcame the ruddy hue of health on his cheeks. His face
assumed the waxen color of death. His
eyes resolved themselves <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span>
into cavernous sockets; his nose disappeared; and presently his
visage was metamorphosed into a grinning skull. The illusion
was perfect. During this ghastly transformation the monks intoned:
“<i>Voilà Machabæus!</i> He dies! He wastes away! Dust
to dust! The eternal worm awaits you all!” A church bell was
solemnly tolled and an organ played. The scene would have
delighted that stern genius, Hans Holbein, whose Dance of
Death has chilled many a human heart. We looked again, and
the skeleton in the coffin vanished. “He has risen to Heaven!”
cried the Capuchins.</p>

<p>In a little while the figure reappeared. The fleshless skull
was merged into the face of my friend. He stepped out of the
box, throwing aside the shroud, and greeted me with a merry
laugh. Other people volunteered to undergo the death scene.
After the exhibition was over one of the Capuchins passed around
a skull for penny contributions, and we left the place.</p>

<p>Now for an explanation of the illusion.</p>

<p>A sheet of glass is placed obliquely across the stage
in front of the coffin. At the side of this stage,
hidden by the proscenium, is another coffin containing
a skeleton robed in white. When the electric lights
surrounding the first coffin are turned off and the
casket containing the skeleton highly illuminated, the
spectators see the reflection of the latter in the glass
and imagine that it is the coffin in which the volunteer
has been placed. To resurrect the man the lights are
reversed.</p></div><!--section-->

<h2 class="h2herein">THE ROMANCE OF AUTOMATA.</h2>

<div class="depigraph">
<p class="pepigraph">“&#x202f;‘What!’ I said to
 myself, ‘can it be possible that the marvelous science
 which raised Vaucanson’s name so high—the science
 whose ingenious combinations can animate inert
 matter, and impart to it a species of existence—is
 the only one without its archives?’&#x202f;”—<span
 class="smcap">R<b>OBERT</b>-H<b>OUDIN.</b></span></p>
 </div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">Automata have played an important part in the magic of
ancient temples, and in the séances of mediæval sorcerers. Who
has not read of the famous “Brazen Head,” constructed by Friar
Bacon, and the wonderful machines of Albertus Magnus? Modern
conjurers have introduced automata into their entertainments
with great effect, as witness Pinetti’s “Wise Little Turk,” Kempelen’s
“Chess Player,” Houdin’s “Pastry Cook of the Palais
Royal,” Kellar’s “Hindoo Clock,” Maskelyne’s “Psycho,” etc.
But these automata have been such in name only, the motive
power usually being furnished by the conjurer’s <i>alter ego</i>, or
concealed assistant.</p>

<p>The so-called automaton Chess Player is enveloped with a
halo of romance. It had a remarkable history. It was constructed
in the year 1769 by the Baron von Kempelen, a Hungarian
nobleman and mechanician, and exhibited by him at the
leading courts of Europe. The Empress Maria Theresa of Austria
played a game with it. In 1783 it was brought to Paris
and shown at the Café de la Regence, the rendezvous of chess
lovers and experts, after which it was taken to London. Kempelen
died on the 26th of March, 1804, and his son sold the
Chess Player to J. N. Maelzel, musician, inventor and mechanician,
who was born at Ratisbon, Bavaria, in 1772. His father
was a celebrated organ-builder. <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span></p>

<p>Maelzel was the inventor of the Metronome (1815), a piece
of mechanism known to all instructors of music: the automaton
<i>Trumpeter</i> (1808), and the <i>Pan-Harmonicum</i> (1805). He had
a strange career as the exhibitor of the Chess Player. After
showing the automaton in various cities of Europe, Maelzel sold
it to Napoleon’s step-son, Eugène Beauharnais, the Viceroy of
the Kingdom of Italy. But the old love of “adventurous travel
with the Turbaned Turk” took possession of him, and he succeeded
in buying back the Chess Player from its royal owner.
He went to Paris with it in 1817 and 1818, afterwards to
London, meeting everywhere with success. In 1826 he brought
it to America. The Chess Player excited the greatest interest
throughout the United States. Noted chess experts did their best
to defeat it, but rarely succeeded.</p>

<span class="smcap">A<b>UTOMATON</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>HESS</b></span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>LAYER.</b></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now for a description of the automaton.</p>

<p>The audience was introduced into a large room, at one end of
which hung crimson curtains. These curtains being drawn aside,
Maelzel rolled forward a box on castors. Behind
the box or <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span>
table, which was two feet and a half high, three feet and a half
long, and two feet wide, was seated cross-legged, the figure of a
Turk. The chair on which the figure was affixed was permanently
attached to the box. At the top of the box was a chess-board.
The figure had its eyes fixed intently upon this board, its
right hand and arm being extended towards the board, its left,
which was somewhat raised, holding a long pipe.</p>

<p>Four doors, two in front, and two in the rear of the box,
were opened, and a lighted candle thrust into the cavities. Nothing
was to be seen except cog wheels, levers, and intricate
machinery. A long drawer, which contained the chessmen and
a cushion, was pulled out. Two doors in the Turk’s body were
thrown open, and the candle held inside, to satisfy the spectators
that nothing but machinery was contained therein.</p>

<p>Maelzel wound up the automaton with a large key, took away
the pipe, and placed the cushion under the arm of the figure.
Curious to relate the automaton played with its left hand. In
Von Kempelen’s day, the person selected to play with the figure,
sat at the same chess-board with it, but Maelzel altered this. A
rope separated the machine from the audience, and the player sat
at a small table, provided with a chess-board, some ten or twelve
feet away from the Turk.</p>

<p>The automaton invariably chose the white chess-men, and
made the first move, its fingers opening as the hand was extended
towards the board, and the piece picked up and removed to its
proper square.</p>

<p>When his antagonist had made his move, the automaton
paused and appeared to study the game, before proceeding further.
It nodded its head to indicate check to the king. If a false move
was made by its opponent, it rapped on the table, and replaced
the piece, claiming the move for itself. Maelzel, acting for the
human player, repeated his move on the chess-board of the Turk,
and when the latter moved, made the corresponding move on the
board of the challenger. The whirring of machinery was heard
during the progress of the game, but this was simply a blind. It
subserved two purposes: <i>first</i>, to induce the spectators to believe
that the automaton was really operated
by ingenious mechanism, <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
<i>second</i>, to disguise the noise made by the concealed confederate
as he shifted himself from one compartment to the other, as the
various doors were opened and shut in succession. No machine
could possibly be constructed to imitate the human mind when
engaged in playing chess, or any other mental operation where
the indeterminate enters and which requires knowledge and
reflection. But the majority of people who saw the automaton
did not realize this fact, and pronounced it a <i>pure machine</i>.</p>

<p>Signor Blitz, the conjurer, who was intimate with Maelzel,
having frequently given entertainments in conjunction with him,
was possessed of the secret of the Turk. In his memoirs, he says:
“The Chess Player was ingeniously constructed—a perfect counterpart
of a magician’s trick-table with a variety of partitions
and doors, which, while they removed every possible appearance
of deception, only produced greater mystery, and provided more
security to the invisible player. The drawers and closets were
so arranged as to enable him to change his position according
to circumstances: at one moment he would be in this compartment;
the next in that; then in the body of the Turk.”</p>

<p>He says this concealed assistant was named Schlumberger.</p>

<p>This explanation is verified by Professor Allen,<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn20" id="fnanc20">20</a> who was
very intimate with Maelzel.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc20" id="fn20">20</a>
Fiske’s <i>Book of the First American Chess Congress</i>,
New York, 1859. Pp. 420–484.</p></div>

<p>William Schlumberger was a native of Alsace, a remarkable
chess expert and linguist. Maelzel picked him up in the Café de
la Regence, Paris, where he eked out a meagre living as a teacher
of chess.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Schlumberger would over-indulge in wine, and
as a result would be beaten, while acting as the motive power of
the Turk. “On one occasion,” says Professor Allen, “just as
Maelzel was bringing the Turk out from behind the curtain, a
strange noise was heard to proceed from his interior organization,
something between a rattle, a cough, and a sneeze. Maelzel
pushed back his ally in evident alarm, but presently brought
him forward again, and went on with the exhibition as if nothing
had happened.” <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span></p>

<p>Schlumberger not only acted as confederate, but served his
employer as secretary and clerk.</p>

<p>Edgar Allen Poe, who wrote an exposé of the automaton
when it visited Richmond, remarked: “There is a man, Schlumberger,
who attends him (Maelzel) wherever he goes, but who
has no ostensible occupation other than that of assisting in packing
and unpacking of the automaton. Whether he professes
to play chess or not, we are not informed. It is quite certain,
however, that he is never to be seen during the exhibition of the
Chess Player, although frequently visible just before and after
the exhibition. Moreover, some years ago Maelzel visited Richmond
with his automaton. Schlumberger was suddenly taken
ill, and during his illness there was no exhibition of the Chess
Player. These facts are well known to many of our citizens. The
reason assigned for the suspension of the Chess Player’s performances
was <i>not</i> the illness of <i>Schlumberger</i>. The inferences
from all this we leave, without further comment, to the reader.”</p>

<p>Edgar Allen Poe, the apostle of mystery, certainly hit the nail
on the head here, and solved the problem of the automaton.</p>

<p>The Chess Player had the honor of defeating Napoleon the
Great—“the Victor in a hundred battles.” This was in the year
1809, when Maelzel, by virtue of his office as Mechanician to
the Court of Austria, was occupying some portion of the Palace
of Schönbrunn, “when Napoleon chose to make the same building
his headquarters during the Wagram campaign.” A man by
the name of Allgaier was the concealed assistant on this occasion.
Napoleon was better versed in the art of manœuvring human
kings, queens, prelates and pawns on the great chess-boards of
diplomacy and battle than moving ivory chessmen on a painted
table-top.</p>

<p>Maelzel, in addition to the Chess Player, exhibited his own
inventions, which were really automatons, also the famous panorama,
“The Burning of Moscow.” After a splendid tour
throughout the States, he went to Havana, Cuba, where poor
Schlumberger died of yellow fever. On the return trip Maelzel
himself died, and was buried at sea. This was in 1838.</p>

<p>The famous Turk, with other of Maelzel’s
effects, was sold <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
at public auction in Philadelphia. The automaton was bought by
Dr. J. K. Mitchell, reconstructed, and privately exhibited by him
for the amusement of his friends. Finally it was deposited in the
Chinese Museum, where it remained for fourteen years, with the
dust accumulating upon it. Here the Chess Player rested from
his labors, a superannuated, broken down pensioner, dreaming, if
automatons can dream, of his past adventures, until the year 1854.
On July 5 of that year a great fire destroyed the Museum, and the
Turbaned Turk was burnt to ashes. Better such a fate than rotting
to pieces in the cellar of some old warehouse, forgotten and
abandoned.</p>

<p>Robert-Houdin, in his autobiography, tells a most romantic
story about the Chess Player, the accuracy of which has been
seriously doubted. He also makes several errors concerning its
career and that of Maelzel. R. Shelton Mackenzie, who translated
Houdin’s life (1859), calls attention to these mistakes, in
his preface to that work. “This remarkable piece of mechanism
was constructed in 1769, and not in 1796; it was the Empress
Maria-Theresa of Austria who played with it, and not Catherine
II of Russia. M. Maelzel’s death was in 1838, on the voyage
from Cuba to the United States, and not, as M. Houdin says, on
his return to France; and the automaton, so far from being taken
back to France, was sold at auction here [Philadelphia], where it
was consumed in the great fire of July 5, 1854.”</p>

<p>I believe that the true history of the Chess Player is related
by Prof. George Allen, of the University of Pennsylvania, in

<p>Now for Houdin’s entertaining story of the Chess Player. In
the year 1796, a revolt broke out in a half-Russian, half-Polish
regiment stationed at Riga, capital of Livonia, Russia. At the
head of the rebels was an officer named Worousky, a man of
talent and energy. He was of short stature, but well built. The
revolutionists were defeated in a pitched battle and
put to flight <span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span>
by the Russians. Worousky had both thighs shattered by a cannon
ball and fell on the battle field. However, he escaped from
the general massacre of his comrades by casting himself into a
ditch near a hedge, not far from the house of a doctor named
Osloff. At nightfall he dragged himself with great difficulty to
the house, and was taken in by the benevolent physician, who
promised to conceal him. Osloff eventually had to amputate
both of Worousky’s legs, close to the body. The operation was
successful. During this time, the famous Baron von Kempelen
came to Russia, and paid Dr. Osloff a visit. He also took compassion
upon the crippled Polish officer. It seems that Worousky
was a master of the game of chess, and repeatedly defeated
Osloff and Kempelen. Kempelen then conceived the idea of the
automaton chess player, as a means of assisting Worousky to
escape from Russia, and immediately set about building it. It
was completed in June, 1796. In order to avert suspicion Osloff
and Kempelen determined to play at several of the smaller towns
and cities before reaching the frontier.</p>

<p>The first performance was given at Toula. Says Houdin:
“I possess a copy of the original bill, which was given me by M.
Hessler, nephew of Dr. Osloff, who also supplied me with all
these details. Worousky won every game he played at Toula,
and the papers were full of praises of the automaton. Assured of
success by the brilliancy of their début, M. de Kempelen and his
companion proceeded towards the frontier.”</p>

<p>Worousky was concealed from sight, while traveling, in the
enormous chest which held the Chess Player. Air holes were
made in the sides of the chest to enable him to breathe. They
arrived without adventure at Vitebsk, on the road to the Prussian
frontier, when a letter came summoning them to the imperial
palace at St. Petersburg. The Empress Catherine II, having
heard of the automaton’s wonderful talent, desired to play a game
with it. They dared not refuse this demand. Worousky, who
had a price set on his head, was the coolest of the three, and
seemed delighted at the idea of playing with the Empress. After
fifteen days travel they reached St. Petersburg. Kempelen had
the automaton carried to the palace in the same
chest in which <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
it traveled, thereby secretly conveying Worousky thither. The
Chess Player was set up in the library, and at the appointed hour
Catherine II, followed by a numerous suite, entered and took her
place at the chess-board. The members of the Court took their
places behind the Empress. Kempelen never allowed anyone to
pass behind the automaton, and would not consent to begin the
game till all the spectators were in front of the board.</p>

<p>“The chest and the Turk’s body were then examined, and
when all were perfectly convinced they contained nothing but
clockwork, the game began. It proceeded for some time in perfect
silence, but Catherine’s frowning brow speedily revealed that
the automaton was not very gallant towards her, and fully deserved
the reputation it had gained. The skillful Mussulman
captured a bishop and a knight, and the game was turning much
to the disadvantage of the lady, when the Turk, suddenly forgetting
his dignified gravity, gave a violent blow on his cushion, and
pushed back a piece his adversary had just moved.</p>

<p>“Catherine II had attempted to cheat; perhaps to try the skill
of the automaton, or for some other reason. At any rate the
haughty empress, unwilling to confess her weakness, replaced the
piece on the same square, and regarded the automaton with an air
of imperious authority. The result was most unexpected—the
Turk upset all the pieces with a blow of his hand, and immediately
the clock work, which had been heard during the whole
game, stopped. It seemed as if the machinery had got out of
repair. Pale and trembling, M. de Kempelen, recognizing in
this Worousky’s impetuous temper, awaited the issue of this
conflict between the insurgent and his sovereign.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Ah, ah! my good automaton! your manners are rather
rough,’ the Empress said, good humoredly, not sorry to see a
game she had small chance of winning end thus. ‘Oh! you are
a famous player, I grant; but you were afraid of losing the game,
and so prudently upset the pieces. Well, I am now quite convinced
of your skill and your violent character.’</p>

<p>“M. de Kempelen began to breathe again, and regaining courage,
tried to remove the unfavorable impression
which the little <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
respect shown by the automaton must have produced. Hence he
said, humbly:</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Will your majesty allow me to offer an explanation of what
has just happened?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘By no means, M. de Kempelen,’ Catherine said, heartily,—‘by
no means; on the contrary, I find it most amusing, and your
automaton pleases me so much that I wish to purchase it. I shall
thus always have near me a player, somewhat quick perhaps, but
yet able to hold his own. You can leave it here tonight, and
come tomorrow morning to arrange the price.’</p>

<p>“There is strong reason to believe that Catherine wished to
commit an indiscretion when she evinced a desire that the figure
should remain at the palace till next morning. Fortunately, the
skillful mechanician managed to baffle her feminine curiosity by
carrying Worousky off in the big chest. The automaton remained
in the library, but the player was no longer there.</p>

<p>“The next day Catherine renewed her proposition to purchase
the Chess Player, but Kempelen made her understand that, as the
figure could not perform without him, he could not possibly sell
it. The empress allowed the justice of these arguments; and,
while complimenting the mechanician on his invention, made him
a handsome present.</p>

<p>“Three months after the automaton was in England, under
the management of Mr. Anthon, to whom Kempelen had sold it.
I know not if Worousky was still attached to it, but I fancy so,
owing to the immense success the Chess Player met with. Mr.
Anthon visited the whole of Europe, always meeting with the
same success; but, at his death, the celebrated automaton was
purchased by Maelzel, who embarked with it for New York. It
was then, probably, Worousky took leave of his hospitable Turk,
for the automaton was not nearly so successful in America.
After exhibiting his mechanical trumpeter and Chess Player for
some time, Maelzel set out again for France, but died on the
passage, of an attack of indigestion. His heirs sold his apparatus,
and thus Cronier obtained his precious relic.” The Chess
Player caused the greatest amount of discussion in its time. At
the solicitation of a leading theatrical manager
of Paris, Houdin <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
arranged the trick for a melodrama, in which Catherine II of
Russia was one of the characters.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>I now come to the celebrated inventions of Maskelyne which
were exhibited at Egyptian Hall, London. First on the list
comes the automaton whist player, “Psycho,” which far exceeds
the Chess Player of Von Kempelen in ingenious construction.
Its secret has never been divulged.</p>

<div class="dctr04"><img src="images/i116.jpg"

J. N. <span class="smcap">M<b>ASKELYNE</b></span>
</div></div>

<p>Says the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>: “In 1875 Maskelyne and Cooke
produced at the Egyptian Hall, in London, an automaton whist
player, ‘Psycho,’ which from the manner in which it is placed
upon the stage, appears to be perfectly isolated
from any <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
mechanical com­mun­i­ca­tion from without .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. The arm has all the
complicated movements necessary for chess or draught playing; and
‘Psycho’ calculates any sum up to a total of 99,000,000. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;.
‘Psycho’, an Oriental figure, sitting cross-legged on a box, is
supported by a single large cylinder of clear glass, which as
originally exhibited, stood upon the carpet of the stage, but was
afterwards set loose upon a small stool, having solid wood feet;
moreover, this automaton may be placed in almost any number of
different ways. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;. It may be mentioned that in the same year in
which ‘Psycho’ appeared, the joint inventors patented a method of
controlling the speed of clockwork mechanism by compressed air or
gas stored in the pedestal of an automaton, this compressed air
acting upon a piston in a cylinder and also upon a rotating fan
when a valve is opened by ‘an electrical or other connection worked
by the foot of the performer or an assistant.’ But it is not known
whether the principle obscurely described in the specification was
applicable in any way to the invisible agency employed in ‘Psycho,’
or whether it had reference to some other invention which has never
been realized.”</p>

<p>A very clever exposé of “Psycho” was published in an English
newspaper, November, 1877. That it is the correct one, I
am by no means certain. But an ingenious mechanic by carrying
out its provisions would be enabled to construct an excellent imitation
of the Maskelyne so-called automaton.</p>

<div class="dctr01"><img src="images/i118.png"
width="600" height="593" alt="" /></div>

<p>“In Figs. <i>1a</i> and <i>1b</i> (elevation and plan), the wheels E and
M have each a train of clockwork (left out for the sake of clearness),
which would cause them to spin round if unchecked. M,
however, has two pins, <i>p&#xa0;p</i>, which catch on a projection on the
lever, N. E is a crown-wheel escapement—like that in a bottle
roasting-jack—which turns A alternately to the left and right,
thus causing the hand to traverse the thirteen cards. A little
higher up on A will be seen a quadrant, B (see plan), near the
edge of which are set thirteen little pins. The end of the lever,
N, drops between any two of them, thus causing the hand to
stop at any desired card. The lever being pivoted at <i>c</i>, it is
obvious that by depressing the end, N, B will be
set at liberty, <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
and the hand will move along the cards; by slightly raising it
this motion will be arrested; by raising it still more the pin, <i>p</i>,
is released, and M commences to revolve, and by again depressing
N this wheel will, in its turn, be stopped. Near the bottom of
the apparatus is a bellows, O, which contains a spring tending
to keep the lever, N, with which it is connected by a rod, X, in
the position shown. This is connected with the tubular support,
which may be connected by a tube through the leg of the stool,
and another tube beneath the stage, with an assistant behind the
scenes. By compressing or exhausting air through this tube it
is obvious that the lever, N, will be raised or depressed, and the
clockwork set going accordingly. <i>a</i> is a crank-pin set in M, and
connected with the head by catgut, T, and with the thumb by
S. At R and R are two pulleys connected by gut.
Thus if the <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
hand moves round, the head appears to follow its motions, and
when raised by pulling S, the head rises also by means of T.
Further explanation seems almost unnecessary; <i>l</i> is a stop to
prevent the elbow moving too far, and <i>b&#xa0;b</i> spiral springs, to keep
the thumb open and the head forward respectively. When N
is raised, M pulls T and S, the latter closing the thumb, and then
raising the arm by pulley H. If the lever is allowed to drop,
<i>p</i> will catch and keep the arm up. On again raising N, the arm
will descend.</p>

<p>“In addition to the above contrivance, we have in Figs. 2 and
3 another and simpler arrangement, in which only one train of
clockwork is used. On the same axle as H is fixed a lever and
weight, W, to balance the arm. A vertical rod, X, having a
projection, Z, slides up and down in guides, Y Y, and carries the
catgut, S and T. The quadrant, B, has cogs cut, between which
Z slides and stops the motion of A, which is moved, as before,
by clockwork. The lower part of X is connected directly with
O. When X is slightly raised, as shown, A is free to move, but
on exhausting the air and drawing X down, Z enters the cogs
and stops the hand over a card; continuing to exhaust, the thumb
closes and the card is lifted up.” The details of the clockwork
the originator of this solution omits to give. He says there
should be a fan on each train to regulate the speed. The figure
should be so placed that an assistant can see the cards in the
semi-circular rack Fig. 4.</p>

<p>One of Maskelyne’s best mechanical tricks is the “Spirit Music-Box,”
for an exposé of which I am indebted to my friend
Mr. Henry V. A. Parsell, of New York City, a lover of the art
of magic. The construction of this novel piece of apparatus will
afford a clue to many alleged mediumistic performances. Professor
Parsons, of New Haven, Conn., is the owner of the box,
reproduced in the illustration. Says Mr. Parsell:</p>

<p>“A sheet of plate glass is exhibited freely to the audience and
proved to contain no electric wires or mechanism. This glass
plate is then suspended horizontally in the center of the stage by
four cords hooked to its corners. An ordinary looking music-box
is then brought in by the assistant. It is
opened, so that <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
the audience can see the usual mechanism within. The music-box
is now placed on the glass plate and the performer comes
down among the spectators. Notwithstanding the isolation of
the box the command of the performer suffices to cause it to
play, or cease, in obedience to his will. It matters not in what
part of the room the conjurer goes—his word is enough to make
silence or harmony issue from the box, always beginning where
it left off and never skipping a note. The simple cause of this
marvelous effect lies in the mechanism of the box and in its
mode of suspension.</p>

</div></div>

<p>“A small music box of this kind is shown in Fig. 5. The box
is seen with its mechanism removed and resting upon it. In addition
to the usual cylinder, comb and wheel-work, there is a
device for starting and stopping the box when it is tilted slightly
endwise. This consists of a light shaft delicately pivoted and
carrying at one end a lead weight (seen just in front of the
cylinder), and at the other end an arm of light wire whose far
end is bent down so as to engage the fly of the wheel-work. In
Fig. 5 the mechanism is tilted so that the wire arm is raised; the
fly is now free to revolve and the box plays.</p>

<p>“A front view of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 6.
Here the arm is down, arresting the motion of the fly
and producing <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
silence. When the box is resting on the glass plate an
assistant behind the scenes causes the plate to tilt
slightly up or down by raising or lowering the cords which
support one end. The mechanism of the box is so delicately
adjusted that an imperceptible motion of the plate is
sufficient to control its playing.”</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>John Nevil Maskelyne, a descendant of Nevil Maskelyne, the
eminent astronomer and physicist, was born in Cheltenham, England,
and like Houdin was apprenticed to a watchmaker. At
an early age, he manifested a wonderful aptitude for mechanics.
He employed most of his spare time while working at the trade
of horology in devising and building optical and mechanical apparatus
for show purposes. In this respect his career exactly
parallels that of Robert-Houdin. He was likewise interested in
sleight of hand tricks, but never carried the art to perfection like
the French magician. Later in life he abandoned legerdemain
entirely and devoted himself exclusively to the construction of
mechanical illusions. In this line, he has no equal. Most of
the really clever and original illusions brought out within the
past twenty years have emanated from his fertile brain. Houdin,
Maskelyne, and Buatier de Kolta are the three great inventors
of magic tricks and illusions. One day the Davenport Brothers
came to Cheltenham and gave an exhibition of their alleged
mediumistic powers at the town hall. Young Maskelyne was
selected as one of a committee to tie the Brothers and examine
their mystic cabinet. The falling of a piece of drugget, used to
exclude light from one of the windows of the hall, enabled
Maskelyne to see Ira Davenport eject some of the musical instruments
from the cabinet, and re-secure himself with the ropes.
Delighted at discovering the trick, the young watchmaker soon
devised an imitation of the Davenport exhibition. Aided by a
Mr. Cooke, afterwards his partner in the show business, he gave
an exposé of the Davenport business, first at Cheltenham, and
afterwards throughout England. Subsequently he located at St.
James Hall, and afterwards at Egyptian
Hall, London. Mr. <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span>
Maskelyne was called as an expert witness in the trial of the
impostor, Dr. Henry Slade, and performed in the witness-box
all of the medium’s “slate tests,” to the great astonishment of the
Court. As a consequence of these revelations, Dr. Slade was
sentenced to three months in jail, but he escaped imprisonment
owing to legal technicalities interposed by his attorneys, and fled
to the Continent. Mr. Maskelyne has written a clever exposé
of gambling devices, entitled, <i>Sharps and Flats</i>, and various
magazine articles on conjuring.</p>

<p>In the year 1904, he and Mr. Cooke moved their show to
St. George’s Hall, having outgrown the old quarters at Egyptian
Hall. Since that time Mr. Cooke died at an advanced age. Associated
with Mr. Maskelyne and his son is David Devant, a
good sleight of hand performer.</p></div><!--section-->

<p class="pfirst">Nostradamus is said to have constructed a magic mirror of
great power. In its shining surface, he conjured up many remarkable
visions. But I know of a more wonderful wizard’s
glass than that of the French necromancer. It is the “mirror
of the mind”—that mystery of mysteries. I am able, at will,
to evoke in it a phan­tas­ma­goria of the past. I need no aid from
cabalistic spells, no burning of incense. Presto!—a picture appears
radiant with light and life. I see a wainscoted room in
a quaint old mansion. Logs are ablaze on the hearthstone. A
boy is ensconced in the deep embrasure of the window. He is
immersed in a book, and entirely oblivious of the scene without,
where the Snow King is busy laying a white pall upon the
frozen earth. Snow flakes like white butterflies skim hither and
thither. The wind rumbles mournfully in the chimneys like a
lost spirit. It is the witching Christmas Tide, when of old the
Magi led by the burning star (the weird pentagram of the Initiates)
came from afar to visit the lowly cradle
of the Nazarene <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
child. Beautiful old legend! It still haunts these later years of
mine, breathing joy and peace ineffable; for is it not an allegory
of the search for, and the discovery of, the Lost Word of the
Adepts of the Temples—the word that signifies eternal life?</p>

<p>Let us take a peep over the reader’s shoulder, at the volume
in his hand. It is the autobiography of “Robert-Houdin, conjurer,
author, and ambassador.” And the reader is myself. O
vanished years of boyhood: you still live in the magic mirror of
memory! And intimately associated with those years is the mystic
book of Robert-Houdin. Can I ever forget the enjoyment I
had in poring over the faded yellow leaves of that fascinating
work? Happy the youth who early dips into its golden pages.
The Arabian Nights forms a fitting prologue to it. I followed
Houdin in the Conjurer’s Caravan; rejoiced in his successes at
the Palais Royal; and in far-off Algeria, watched him exhibiting
his magic feats before the Marabouts.</p>

<p>Speaking of this autobiography, Professor Brander Matthews
of Columbia College, New York, says: “These <i>Confidences of
a Prestidigitateur</i> are worthy of comparison with all but the very
best autobiographies—if not with Cellini’s and Franklin’s, at
least with Cibber’s and Goldoni’s. Robert-Houdin’s life of himself,
quite as well as any of the others, would justify Longfellow’s
assertion that ‘autobiography is what biography ought to be.’&#x202f;”</p>

<p>In my humble opinion Houdin’s autobiography is worthy to
be classed with the best, even that of Cellini and Franklin; yes,
even with Chateaubriand’s superb <i>Memories beyond the Tomb</i>.
It is replete with interesting information about old time necromancers;
constructors of automata; good stories of contemporary
magicians; exposés of Marabout miracles; and last, but not least,
the fascinating adventures of Houdin himself,—the archmaster
of modern magic. It bears the stamp of truth on every page,
and should be placed in the hands of all students of psychology
and pedagogy. His <i>Trickeries of the Greeks</i>, an exposé of
gambling devices, is also an interesting work and should be read
in conjunction with his <i>Stage Magic</i> and <i>Conjuring and Magic</i>.</p>

<p>The Confidences end with Houdin’s retirement from the stage
to his villa at St. Gervais, near Blois. The
book on <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span> <i>Conjuring
and Magic</i> gives us a slight sketch of his villa and the ingenious
contrivances arranged therein for the amusement and mystification
of visitors. The curtain, alas, then rings down on the scene.
The theatre is left dark and cold. We are told nothing more
concerning the great conjurer’s life, or the manner of his death.
All is a blank. Through my own efforts, however, and those of
my friends made in recent years, at my instigation, I have been
able to supply the missing data. It is very entertaining indeed.
But let us begin at the beginning.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">II.</h3>

<p>On a certain day in the year 1843, the Count de l’Escalopier,
a scion of the old régime of France, and a great lover of curios,
was strolling along the Rue de Vendôme, in the Marais Quarter,
of Paris. He stopped to look at some mechanical toys displayed
in the window of a dark little shop, over the door of which was
painted the following modest sign: “M. Robert-Houdin, Pendules
de Précision.” This sign noted the fact that the proprietor
was a watchmaker, and that his wares were distinguished for
precise running. What particularly attracted the nobleman’s attention
was a peculiar looking clock of clearest crystal that ran
apparently without works, the invention of M. Robert-Houdin.
The Count, who was a great lover of <i>science amusante</i>, or science
wedded to recreation, purchased the magic clock, and better than
that, made the acquaintance of the inventor, the obscure watchmaker,
who was destined to become a great pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur,
author, and ambassador. The Count became a frequent visitor
at Houdin’s shop, to watch the construction of various automata,
which the inventor intended some day to use in public performances.
Says Houdin: “A kind of intimacy having thus become
established between M. de l’Escalopier and myself, I was naturally
led to talk to him of my projects of appearing in public; and,
in order to justify them, I had given him, on more than one
occasion, specimens of my skill in sleight of hand. Prompted
doubtless by his friendly feelings, my spectator steadily applauded
me, and gave me the warmest encouragement to put my schemes
into actual practice. Count de l’Escalopier,
who was the <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
possessor of a considerable fortune, lived in one of those splendid
houses which surround the square which has been called <i>Royale</i>,
or <i>des Vosges</i>, according to the color of the flag of our masters
of the time being. I myself lived in a humble lodging in the
Rue de Vendôme, in the Marais, but the wide disproportion in
the style of our respective dwelling-places did not prevent the
nobleman and the artist from addressing each other as ‘my dear
neighbor,’ or sometimes even as ‘my dear friend.’</p>

“The cut represents the magic clock invented by Robert-Houdin about
sixty years ago. This very remarkable time-piece consists of a dial composed
of two juxtaposed disks of glass, one of which is stationary and carries
the hours, while the other is movable and serves for the motion of the hands.
This latter disk is provided with a wheel or rather a toothed ring concealed
within the metallic ring forming a dial. The glass column which constitutes
the body of the piece is formed of two tubes which operate according to the
principle of the dial, that is to say, one is stationary and the other movable.
To each of the extremities of the latter is fixed a wheel. These wheels gear
with transmission pinions which communicate, one of them at the top with the
movable plate of glass of the dial, and the other at the bottom with the movement
placed in the wooden base which supports the glass shade covering the
clock. All these concealed transmissions are arranged in a most skillful
manner, and complete the illusion. The movable glass of the dial, carried
along by the column, actuates a small dial-train mounted in the thickness of
the stationary glass, and within an extremely narrow space in the center of
the dial. It is covered by the small hand and is consequently invisible. The
hands are very easily actuated by it on account of their extreme lightness
and perfect equilibrium.”—<i>Scientific American, N. Y.</i></p></div>

<p>“My neighbor then being, as I have just stated, warmly in­ter­est­ed
in my projects, was cons­tantly talking of them; and in
order to give me op­por­tu­ni­ties of practice in my future pro­fes­sion,
and to enable me to acquire that confidence in which I was
then wanting, he frequently invited me to pass the evening in
the company of a few friends of his own, whom I was delighted
to amuse with my feats of dexterity. It was after a dinner given
by M. de l’Escalopier to the Archbishop of Paris, Monseigneur
Affre, with whom he was on intimate terms, that I had the honor
of being presented to the reverend prelate as a mechanician and
future magician, and that I performed before him a selection of
the best of my experiments.</p>

<p>“At that period—I don’t say it in order to gratify a retrospective
vanity—my skill in sleight of hand was of a high order.
I am warranted in this belief by the fact that my numerous
audiences exhibited the greatest wonderment at my performance,
and that the Archbishop himself paid me, in his own handwriting,
a compliment which I can not refrain from here relating.</p>

<p>“I had reserved for the last item of my programme a trick
which, to use a familiar expression, I had at my fingers’ ends.
In effect it was shortly as follows:—After having requested the
spectators carefully to examine a large envelope sealed on all
sides, I handed it to the Archbishop’s Grand Vicar, begging him
to keep it in his own possession. Next, handing to the prelate
himself a small slip of paper, I requested him to write thereon,
secretly, a sentence, or whatever he might choose to think of;
the paper was then folded in four, and (apparently) burnt. But
scarcely was it consumed and the ashes scattered to the winds,
than, handing the envelope to the Archbishop, I requested him
to open it. The first envelope being removed a second was
found, sealed in like manner; then another, until a dozen envelopes,
one inside another, had been opened, the last containing
the scrap of paper restored intact. It was passed from hand
to hand, and each read as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Though I do not claim to be a prophet, I venture to predict,
sir, that you will achieve brilliant success in your future
career.’ <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span></p>

<p>“I begged Monseigneur Affre’s permission to keep the autograph
in question, which he very graciously gave me.”</p>

<p>Poor Archbishop Affre; he was killed at the barricades in
the Revolution of 1848. Though he confessed that he was no
prophet, yet his prediction was fulfilled to the letter. Houdin
became the foremost conjurer of his age, of any age in fact, and
has left to posterity more than a name:—his fascinating memoirs,
and several works in which the psychology of deception is treated
in a masterly manner. The slip of paper given to him by the
Archbishop he preserved as a religious relic. “I kept it,” he
said, “in a secret corner of my pocket-book which I always carried
about my person. During my travels in Algeria I had the
misfortune to lose both this pocket-book and the precious object
it contained.”</p>

<p>After the séance recorded above, the Count de l’Escalopier
urged Houdin continually to abandon the watchmaking and
mechanical-toy trade and go on the stage as a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur.
Finally Houdin confessed his inability to do so, owing to lack
of means, whereupon the kind-hearted nobleman exclaimed:
“<i>Mon cher ami</i>, I have at home, at this very moment, ten thousand
francs or so, which I really don’t know what to do with.
Do me the favor to borrow them for an indefinite period: you
will be doing me an actual service.”</p>

<p>But Houdin would not accept the offer, for he was loth to
risk a friend’s money in a theatrical speculation. The Count in
a state of pique left the shop and did not return for many days.
Then he rushed excitedly into the workroom, sank upon a chair,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My dear neighbor, since you are determined not to accept a
favor from me, I have now come to beg one of you. This is the
status of the case. For the last year my desk has been robbed
from time to time of very considerable sums of money. In vain
have I endeavored to ascertain the thief. I have sent away my
servants, one after another. I have had the place watched,
changed the locks, and placed secret fastenings on the doors, but
none of these safeguards and precautions have foiled the cunning
of the miscreant. This very morning a
couple of thousand <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
franc-notes disappeared. Think of the frightful position the entire
family is placed in. Can you not come to my assistance?”</p>

<p>“Count,” replied Houdin, “I fail to see how I can help you
in the present instance. My magic power, unfortunately, extends
only to my finger tips.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the Count, “but you have a mighty aid
in mechanics.”</p>

<p>“Mechanics,” exclaimed the magician. “Stop a bit! I remember
when I was a boy at school that I invented a primitive
piece of apparatus to apprehend a rascal who was in the habit
of stealing my boyish possessions. I will improve upon that idea.
Come to see me in a few days.”</p>

<p>Houdin put on his thinking-cap and shut himself up in his
workshop.</p>

<p>From his inner consciousness he evolved a singularly ingenious
contrivance, designed not only to discover a thief, but
to brand him indelibly for his crime. In brief let me describe it.
It was an apparatus to be fastened to the inside of a desk. When
the desk was unlocked, and the lid raised ever so little, a pistol
was discharged; at the same time a claw-like arrangement, attached
to a light rod and impelled by a spring, came sharply
down on the back of the hand which held the key. This claw
was a tatooing instrument. It consisted of “a number of very
short but sharp points, so arranged as to form the word <i>Robber</i>.
These points were brought through a pad impregnated with nitrate
of silver, a portion of which was forced by the blow into
the punctures, and made the scars indelible for life.”</p>

<p>When the Count saw this apparatus at work, the inventor
using a heavily-padded glove to prevent being wounded by the
claw, he objected to it strenuously, remarking that he had no
right to brand a criminal. That was the province of Justice.
He also argued that it would be wrong from a humanitarian
standpoint. A poor wretch thus branded could only get rid of
it by a horrible self-mutilation. If he failed in his endeavor, it
might close the door of repentance forever against him, and
class him permanently among the enemies of the social order.
“Worse than that,” said the Count, “suppose
some member of <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
my family by inadvertence, or through some fatal mistake, should
fall a victim to our stern precautions; and
<span class="nowrap">then<img class="iglyph-a"
 src="images/dash-2em.png" width="141"
 height="60" alt="——" />”</span></p>

<p>“You are quite right!” said Houdin. “I had not thought of
those objections. I was carried away by my enthusiasm as an
inventor. You are quite right! I will alter the apparatus at
once.”</p>

<p>In the place of the branding contrivance, he inserted a kind
of cat’s-claw, which would make a slight scratch on the hand—a
mere superficial wound, readily healed. The Count was satisfied
with the alteration, and the apparatus was secretly fixed
to the desk in the nobleman’s bed-room.</p>

<p>In order to stimulate the cupidity of the robber, the Count
drew considerable money from his bankers. He even made a
pretence of leaving Paris on a trip to a short distance. But the
bait did not take. Sixteen days passed away. The Count had
almost despaired of catching the culprit, when one morning while
reading in his library, which was some little distance from the
bed-room, he heard the report of a pistol.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he exclaimed, excitedly. “The robber at last.” Picking
up the first weapon to hand, a battle axe from a stand of
ancestral armor near by, he ran quickly to the bed-room. There
stood his trusted valet, Bernard, who had been in his household
for many years.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” asked the Count.</p>

<p>With great coolness and audacity, Bernard explained that
he had been brought thither by the noise of the explosion, and
had just seen a man making his escape down the back stairs.
The Count rushed down the stairs only to find the door locked.
A frightful thought overcame him: “Could Bernard be the
thief?” He returned to the bed-room. The valet, he noticed,
kept his right hand behind him. The Count dragged it forcibly
in sight, and saw that it was covered with blood.</p>

<p>“Infamous scoundrel!” said the nobleman, as he flung the
man from him in disgust.</p>

<p>“Mercy, mercy!” cried the criminal, falling
upon his knees. <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span></p>

<p>“How long have you been robbing me?” asked the Count,
sternly.</p>

<p>“For nearly two years.”</p>

<p>“And how much have you taken?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell exactly. Perhaps 15,000 francs, or thereabouts.”</p>

<p>“We will call it 15,000 francs. You may keep the rest.
What have you done with the money?”</p>

<p>“I have invested it in Government stock. The scrip is in my
desk.”</p>

<p>The thief yielded up the securities to the amount of fifteen
thousand francs, and wrote a confession of his guilt, which he
signed in the presence of a witness. The kind-hearted nobleman,
bidding the valet repent of his crime, forthwith dismissed him
from his employ, agreeing not to prosecute him provided he led
an honest life. One year from that date, the wretched Bernard
died. Remorse hastened his end.</p>

<p>M. de l’Escalopier took the money thus recovered to Houdin,
saying: “I do hope, my dear friend, that you will no longer
refuse me the pleasure of lending you this sum, which I owe
entirely to your ingenuity and mechanical skill. Take it, return
it to me just when you like, with the understanding that it is to
be repaid only out of the profits of your theatre.”</p>

<p>Overcome by emotion at the generosity of his benefactor,
Houdin embraced the Count. “This embrace,” he says, “was the
only security which M. de l’Escalopier would accept from me.”</p>

<p>This was the turning point of the conjurer’s life. “It is an
ill wind that blows nobody good.”</p>

<p>With this money Houdin without further delay built in the
Palais Royal a little theatre. “The galleries which surround the
garden of the Palais Royal are divided,” says Houdin, “into
successive arches, occupied by shops. Above these arches there
are, on the first floor, spacious suites of apartments, used as
public assembly rooms, clubs, cafés, etc. It was in the space
occupied by one of these suites, at No. 164 of the
Rue de Valois, <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span>
that I built my theatre, which extended, in width, over three of
the above-mentioned arches; and in length the distance between
the garden of the Palais Royal and the Rue de Valois, or, in
other words, the whole depth of the building.” The dimensions
of this miniature theatre were very limited. It would not seat
over two hundred people. Though the seats were few in number,
their prices were tolerably high. Children were paid for as
grown persons.</p>

<p>The Palais Royal was formerly the residence of Cardinal
Richelieu, the “Red Duke,” and afterwards became the home
of the Orléans family. The Regent d’Orléans, in the reign of
Louis XV, experimented with magic mirrors in this building.
It was in the Palais Royal that the French Revolution was
hatched. Could a more favorable place have been selected in
which to start a revolution in conjuring? I think not.</p>

<p>The following is the announcement of Houdin’s first performance,
which appeared on the bill-boards of Paris:</p>

<div class="dctr01">

<p>“On this day,” says Houdin, “by a strange coincidence,
the Hippodrome and the ‘Fantastic Soirées’ of
Robert-Houdin, the largest and smallest stage in Paris,
were opened to the public. The 3d of July, 1845, saw
two bills placarded on the walls of Paris; one enormous
belonging to the Hippodrome, while the other of far more
modest proportions, announced my performances. Still as
in the fable of the reed and the oak, the large theatre,
in spite of the skill of the managers, has undergone many
changes of fortune; while the smaller one has continually
enjoyed the public favor. I have sacredly kept a proof of
my first bill, the form and color of which have always
remained the same since that date. I copy it word for word

<p>These fantastic evenings soon became popular. When the
Revolution of 1848 ruined the majority of Parisian theater managers,
Houdin simply locked the door of his hall, and retired
to his little workshop to invent new tricks and automata. His
loss was very slight, for he was under no great expense. When
order was restored, he resumed the <i>soirées magiques</i>. The newspapers
rallied to his assistance and made playful
allusions to his <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
being related to the family of <i>Robert le Diable</i>. The leading
illustrated journals sent artists to draw pictures of his stage.
Houdin found time, amid all his labors, to edit a little paper
which he called <i>Cagliostro</i>, full of <i>bon mots</i> and pleasantries, to
say nothing of cartoons. Copies of this <i>petit journal pour rire</i>
were distributed among the spectators at each performance.</p>

<p>As each theatrical season opened, Houdin had some new
marvel to present to his audiences. His maxims were: “It
is more difficult to support admiration than to excite
it.” “The fashion an artist enjoys can only last as long
as his talent daily increases.” Houdin had but few, if
any, rivals in his day. His tricks were all new, or so
improved as to appear new. He swept everything before
him. When he went to London for a prolonged engagement,
Anderson, the “Wizard of the North,” who was a great
favorite with the public, retired into the Provinces with
his antique repertoire. What had the English conjurer to
offer alongside of such unique novelties as the <i>Second
Sight</i>, <i>Aerial Suspension</i>, <i>Inexhaustible Bottle</i>,
<i>Mysterious Portfolio</i>, <i>Crystal Cash Box</i>, <i>Shower of
Gold</i>, <i>Light and Heavy Chest</i>, <i>Orange Tree</i>, <i>the

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>Jean-Eugène Robert (Houdin) was born on December 6,
1805, in the quaint old city of Blois, the birth-place of Louis
XII. and of Papin, the inventor of the steam engine. Napoleon
was at the zenith of his fame, and had just fought the bloody
battle of Austerlitz.</p>

<p>Luckily for the subject of this sketch, he was born too late
to serve as food for powder. He lived to grow to man’s estate
and honorable old age, and became the veritable Napoleon of
necromancy. His career makes fascinating reading. Houdin’s
father was a watchmaker, and from him he inherited his remarkable
mechanical genius. At the age of eleven, Jean-Eugène was
sent to college at Orleans. On the completion of his studies, he
entered a notary’s office at Blois, but spent most of his time inventing
little mechanical toys and devices,
instead of engrossing <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
dusty parchment, so the notary advised him to abandon the idea
of becoming a lawyer and take up a mechanical trade. Houdin
joyfully took up his father’s occupation of watchmaking, for
which he had a decided bent. One evening the young apprentice
went to a bookseller’s shop in Blois and asked for a work on
horology by Berthoud. The shopman by mistake handed him a
couple of odd volumes of the <i>Encyclopédie</i>, which somewhat resembled
Berthoud’s book. Jean-Eugène went home to his attic,
lit a candle, and prepared to devote an evening to hard study, but
judge of his surprise to find that the supposed treatise on watchmaking
was a work on natural magic and pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion, under
the head of scientific amusements. He was delighted at the
revelations contained in the mystic volume, which told how to
perform tricks with the cards, to cut off a pigeon’s head and
restore it again, etc., etc. Here was an introduction to the New
Arabian Nights of enchantment. He slept with the book under
his pillow, and possibly dreamed of African wizards, genii, and
all sorts of incantations. This little incident brought about great
changes in Houdin’s life. He secretly vowed to become a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur,—a
rôle for which he was eminently fitted, psy­cho­log­i­cally
and physically. The principles of sleight of hand Houdin
had to create for himself, for the mystic volume, though it revealed
the secrets of the tricks, gave the neophyte no adequate
idea of the subtle passes and misdirection required to properly
execute them.</p>

<p>Though an ardent devotee of legerdemain, Houdin did not
neglect his trade of watchmaker. When his apprenticeship was
over, he went to Tours as a journeyman, in the shop of M.
Noriet, who afterwards became a noted sculptor. While in the
employ of M. Noriet, Houdin was poisoned by eating a ragôut
cooked in a stew pan in which there chanced to be verdigris. He
was very ill, and his life was saved with difficulty. Possessed
with the idea that he was soon to die, he escaped one day from
his nurse and doctor and set out for Blois to bid adieu to his
family before he departed from this sublunary sphere. A most
singular adventure befell him, which reads like a romance.
Those who believe in destiny have here a curious
example of its <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
strange workings. The jolting of the lumbering old diligence
gave Houdin great pain. He was burning with fever and delirious.
Without any one knowing it, he opened the door of the
<i>rotonde</i>, in which he happened to be the only passenger, and
leaped out on the high road, where he lay unconscious. When
he recovered his senses, he found himself lying in a comfortable
bed. An unknown man with a phial of medicine in his hand
bent over him. By the strangest luck, Houdin had fallen into
the hands of a traveling conjurer named Torrini, who went
about the country in a sort of house on wheels, which was drawn
by a pair of big Norman horses. This unique vehicle which was
six yards in length could be converted into a miniature theatre
twice its size by an ingenious mechanical arrangement. The body
was telescopic and could be drawn out, the projection being supported
by trestles. Torrini early in life had been a physician and
was able to tend his patient with intelligence and skill. Finding
the young watchmaker a clever mechanician, Torrini gave him
some magical automata to repair, and Houdin was introduced for
the first time to the little Harlequin that jumps out of a box and
performs various feats at the mandate of the conjurer. A delightful
friendship began between the watchmaker and the wizard.
Torrini, who was an expert with cards, initiated Houdin into the
secrets of many clever tricks performed with the pasteboards. He
also corrected his pupil’s numerous mistakes in legerdemain, into
which all self-educated amateurs fall. It was a fascinating life
led in this conjurer’s caravan. Besides Torrini and Houdin there
was Antonio, the assistant, and man of all work. Torrini related
many amusing adventures to his young pupil, which the latter has
recorded in his admirable autobiography. It was he, the <i>ci-devint</i>,
Comte de Grisy who performed the famous watch trick
before Pius VII. and had so unique revenge upon the Chevalier
Pinetti.</p>

<p>Torrini’s son was accidentally shot by a spectator in the gun
trick during a performance at Strasburg, as has been explained
in the chapter on the “History of Natural Magic and Prestidigitation.”
Overcome with grief at the loss of his only child and
at the subsequent death of his wife, he abandoned
the great cities <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
and wandered about the French Provinces attended by has faithful
assistant and brother-in-law, Antonio. But to return to Robert-Houdin.</p>

<p>One day at Aubusson the conjurer’s caravan collided with an
enormous hay cart. Houdin and Antonio escaped with light contusions,
but the Master had a leg broken and an arm dislocated.
The two horses were killed; as for the carriage, only the body remained
intact; all the rest was smashed to atoms. During Torrini’s
illness, Houdin, assisted by Antonio, gave a conjuring performance
at the town hall to replete the exchequer. Houdin succeeded
very well in his first attempt, with the exception that he
ruined a gentleman’s chapeau while performing the trick of the
omelet in the hat.</p>

<p>Soon after this Houdin bid adieu to Torrini and returned to
his parents at Blois. He never saw Torrini again in this life.
After following watchmaking at Blois for quite a little while, he
proceeded to Paris, with his wife,—for he had not only taken unto
himself a spouse, but had adopted her name, Houdin, as part of
his own cognomen. He was now Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin,
master-watchmaker. His recontre with the Count de l’Escalopier
and the result have already been given.</p>

<p>Houdin completely revolutionized the art of conjuring. Prior
to his time, the tables used by magicians were little else than huge
confederate boxes. Conjuring under such circumstances was
child’s play, as compared with the difficulties to be encountered
with the apparatus of the new school. In addition, Houdin discarded
the long, flowing robes of many of his predecessors, and
appeared in evening dress. Since his time all first-class pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teurs
have followed his example, both as to dress and
tables.</p>

<p>Houdin’s center-table was a marvel of mechanical skill and
ingenuity. Concealed in the body were “vertical rods, each arranged
to rise and fall in a tube, according as it was drawn down
by a spiral spring or pulled up by a whip-cord which passed over
a pulley at the top of the tube and so down the table-leg to the
hiding-place of the confederate.” There were “ten of these pistons,
and ten cords passing under the floor
of the stage, <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
terminating at a key-board. Various ingenious automata were actuated
by this means of transmitting motion.”</p>

<p>Houdin’s stage was very handsome. It was a replica in
miniature of a salon of the Louis XV. period—all in white and
gold—illuminated by elegant candelabra and a chandelier. The
magic table occupied the center of the room. This piece of furniture
was flanked by little guéridons. At the sides were consoles,
with about five inches of gold fringe hanging from them,
and across the back of the apartment ran a broad shelf, upon
which was displayed the various apparatus to be used in the
séances. “The consoles were nothing more than shallow wooden
boxes with openings through the side-scenes. The tops of the
consoles were perforated with traps. Any object which the wizard
desired to work off secretly to his confederate behind the
scenes was placed on one of these traps and covered with a sheet
of paper, pasteboard cover or a handkerchief. Touching a spring
caused the article to fall noiselessly through the trap upon cotton
batting, and roll into the hand of the conjurer’s concealed assistant.”</p>

<span class="smcap">H<b>OUDIN’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">T<b>RICK</b>-T<b>ABLE.</b></span></div></div>

<p>Now for a few of the tricks of this classic pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur.
His greatest invention was the “light and heavy chest.” Speaking
of this remarkable experiment he wrote: “I do not think,
modesty apart, that I ever invented anything so daringly ingenious.”
The magician came forward with a
little wooden box, <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
to the top of which was attached a metal handle. He addressed
the audience as follows: “Ladies and gentlemen. I have a cash-box
which possesses strange properties. It becomes heavy or
light at will. I place in it some banknotes for safekeeping and
deposit it here on the ‘run-down’ in sight of all. Will some gentleman
test the lightness of the box?”</p>

<p>When the volunteer had satisfied the audience that the box
could be lifted with the little finger, Houdin executed some pretended
mesmeric passes over it, and bade the gentleman lift it a
second time. But try as he might, the volunteer would prove unequal
to the task. At a sign from Houdin the box would be restored
to its pristine lightness. This trick was performed with a
powerful electro-magnet with conducting wires reaching behind
the scenes to a battery. At a signal from the performer an operator
turned on the electric current, and the box, which had an iron
plate let into its bottom, covered with mahogany-colored paper,
clung to the magnet with supernatural attraction. In the year
1845, the phenomena of electro-magnetism were unknown to
the general public, hence the spirit cash-box created the
most extraordinary sensation. When the subject of electricity
became better known, Houdin made an addition to the feat
which threw his spectators off the scent. After first having
shown the trick on the “run-down,” he hooked the box to one
end of a cord which passed over a pulley attached to the ceiling
of the hall. A spectator was requested to take hold of the other
end of the cord and keep the chest suspended.</p>

<p>“Just at present,” remarked the conjurer, “the chest is extremely
light; but as it is about to become, at my command, very
heavy, I must ask five or six other persons to help this gentleman,
for fear the chest should lift him off his feet.”</p>

<p>No sooner was this done than the chest came heavily to the
ground, dragging along and sometimes lifting off their feet all
the spectators who were holding the cord. The explanation is
this: On a casual inspection of the pulley and block everything
appears to indicate that, as usual in such cases, the cord passes
straight over the pulley, in on one side and out on the other; but
such is not really the fact, as will be seen upon
tracing the course <span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span>
of the dotted lines (Fig. 1), which, passing through the block
and through the ceiling, are attached on either side to a double
pulley fixed in the room above. To any one who has the most
elementary acquaintance with the laws of mechanics, it will be
obvious that the strength of the person who holds the handle of
the windlass above is multiplied tenfold, and that he can easily
overcome even the combined resistance of five or six spectators.</p>

<p>The “Bust of Socrates” was another favorite experiment with
Houdin. In this illusion a living bust with the features of Socrates
was suspended in the middle of the stage without visible
support. The performer, habited as an Athenian noble, addressed
questions to the mutilated philosopher and received replies in
stanzas of elegiac verse. The <i>mise en scène</i> is represented in
Fig. 2. Houdin explains the illusion as follows:</p>

<p>“<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, (Fig. 3)
represent a section of the stage on
which the trick is exhibited. A sheet of silvered glass, <i>G</i>, <i>G</i>,
occupying the whole width of the stage, is placed in a diagonal
position, extending from the upper part of the stage at the rear,
down to the footlights, so as to form an angle of forty-five
degrees with the floor. In the center of the glass is an opening
through which <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span>
the actor passes his head and shoulders, as shown in the figure.
It should be further mentioned that the ceiling and the two sides
of the stage are hung with wall-paper of the same pattern, and
are brilliantly illuminated, either by means of footlights at <i>C</i>,
or by gas-jets placed behind the border <i>A</i>. Such being the condition
of things, the effect is as follows: The ceiling <i>A</i> is
reflected in the mirror, and its reflection appears to the spectators
to be the paper of the wall <i>B</i>, <i>D</i>, which in reality is hidden by
the glass.</p>

<p>“By means of this reflection, of which he is of course
unaware, the spectator is led to believe that he sees three sides of
the stage; and there being nothing to suggest to his mind the
presence of the glass, he is led to believe that the bust is suspended
in mid-air and without any support.”</p>

<p>“Aerial Suspension” was one of Houdin’s inventions. It has
been a favorite trick since his time. In the original illusion Houdin
had one of his young sons, who was dressed as a page, stand
on a small stool. The performer then placed a walking-stick
under the extended right arm of the boy, near the elbow, and
one under the left arm. First the stool was knocked away and the
youthful assistant was suspended in the air, held up only by the
two frail sticks, which were in themselves inadequate to support
such a weight. Then the left stick was removed, but the
boy did not fall. To the astonishment of every
one, the youth <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
was placed in a horizontal position. He remained in a perfectly
rigid attitude with his head leaning on his arm, the top of the cane
under his elbow.</p>

<p>This very ingenious trick was suggested to Houdin on reading
stories about the alleged levitation of Hindoo fakirs. The
walking-stick that supported the right arm of the assistant was of
iron, painted to resemble wood. It fitted into a slot in the stage;
its top connected with a bar concealed in the sleeve of the boy.
This bar formed part of a strong steel framework worn under the
assistant’s clothing. Thus was the page suspended in the air.</p>

<p>Houdin’s trick of the “orange-tree” was a capital one. The
tree blossomed and bore fruit at the command of the conjurer. All
the oranges were distributed among the spectators except one on
the topmost branch of the tree. In this orange the magician
caused a handkerchief to appear, which had been previously borrowed.
The handkerchief was made to vanish from the hands of
the performer. “Hey, presto!” the orange fell apart in four
sections, whereupon two butterflies sprang out and fluttered upward
with the handkerchief. The explanation of this beautiful
trick is as follows: The tree was a clever piece of mechanism,
so closely fashioned to resemble a plant that it was impossible to
detect the difference. The blossoms, constructed of white silk,
were pushed up through the hollow branches by pistons rising
in the table and operating upon similar rods contained in the tree.
When these pedals were relaxed the blossoms disappeared, and
the fruit was slowly developed. Real oranges were stuck on
iron spikes protruding from the branches of the tree, and were
concealed from the spectators by hemispherical wire screens
painted green. The screens were also partly hidden by the artificial
foliage. By means of cords running down through the
branches of the tree and off behind the scenes, an assistant caused
the screens to make a half-turn, thereby developing the fruit.
The borrowed handkerchief was exchanged for a dummy belonging
to the conjurer, and passed to an assistant who placed it in
the mechanical orange. The tree was now brought forward.
After the real fruit had been distributed, the magician called
attention to the orange on the top (the
mechanical one). By <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
means of sleight of hand the handkerchief was made to vanish,
to be discovered in the orange. The butterflies, which were fastened
by wires to the stalk and fixed on delicate spiral springs,
invisible at a little distance, flew out of the orange of their own
accord, carrying with them the handkerchief, as soon as the
fruit fell apart.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>In the year 1846 Houdin was summoned to the Palace of
Saint-Cloud to give a performance before Louis Philippe and his
Court, whereupon he invented his remarkable trick of the enchanted
casket, which created great excitement in the Parisian
journals, and gained him no little fame. He had six days to prepare
for the <i>séance magique</i>. Early on the appointed morning
a van from the royal stables came to convey him and his son,
together with the magic paraphernalia, to the palace of the king.
A stage had been erected in one of the handsome salons of St.
Cloud, the windows of which opened out on an orangery lined
with double rows of orange-trees, “each growing in its square
box on wheels. A sentry was placed at the door to see that the
conjurer was not disturbed in his preparations. The King himself
dropped in once to ask the entertainer if he had everything
necessary.”</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon, a brilliant company assembled
in the hall to witness the performance. The <i>pièce de résistance</i>
of the séance was Cagliostro’s casket, the effect of which
is best described in Houdin’s own words:</p>

<p>“I borrowed from my noble spectators several handkerchiefs,
which I made into a parcel, and laid on the table. Then, at my
request, different persons wrote on blank cards the names of
places whither they desired their handkerchiefs to be invisibly
transported.</p>

<p>“When this had been done, I begged the King to take three
of the cards at hazard, and choose from them the place he might
consider most suitable.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Let us see,’ Louis Philippe said, ‘what this one says: “I
desire the handkerchiefs to be found beneath
one of the <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
candelabra on the mantelpiece.” That is too easy for a sorcerer; so
we will pass to the next card: “The handkerchiefs are to be
transported to the dome of the Invalides.” That would suit me,
but it is much too far, not for the handkerchiefs, but for us, ‘Ah,
ah!’ the King added, looking at the last card, ‘I am afraid,
Monsieur Robert-Houdin, I am about to embarrass you. Do
you know what this card proposes?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Will your majesty deign to inform me?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘It is desired that you should send the handkerchiefs into
the chest of the last orange-tree on the right of the avenue.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Only that, sir? Deign to order, and I will obey.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Very good, then; I should like to see such a magic act: I,
therefore, choose the orange-tree chest.’</p>

<p>“The king gave some orders in a low voice, and I directly
saw several persons run to the orange-tree, in order to watch it
and prevent any fraud.</p>

<p>“I was delighted at this precaution, which must add to the
effect of my experiment, for the trick was already arranged, and
the precaution hence too late.</p>

<p>“I had now to send the handkerchiefs on their travels, so I
placed them beneath a bell of opaque glass, and, taking my wand,
I ordered my invisible travelers to proceed to the spot the king
had chosen.</p>

<p>“I raised the bell; the little parcel was no longer there, and a
white turtle-dove had taken its place.</p>

<p>“The King then walked quickly to the door, whence he looked
in the direction of the orange-tree, to assure himself that the
guards were at their post; when this was done, he began to smile
and shrug his shoulders.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Ah! Monsieur Houdin,’ he said, somewhat ironically, ‘I
much fear for the virtue of your magic staff.’ Then he added, as
he returned to the end of the room, where several servants were
standing, ‘Tell William to open immediately the last chest at the
end of the avenue, and bring me carefully what he finds there—if
he <i>does</i> find anything.’</p>

<p>“William soon proceeded to the orange-tree, and though much
astonished at the orders given him, he began to
carry them out. <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span></p>

<p>“He carefully removed one of the sides of the chest, thrust
his hand in, and almost touched the roots of the tree before he
found anything. All at once he uttered a cry of surprise, as he
drew out a small iron coffer eaten by rust.</p>

<p>“This curious ‘find,’ after having been cleansed of the
mould, was brought in and placed on a small ottoman by the
king’s side.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Well, Monsieur Robert-Houdin,’ Louis Philippe said to
me, with a movement of impatient curiosity, ‘here is a box; am I
to conclude it contains the handkerchiefs?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Yes, sire,’ I replied, with assurance, ‘and they have been
there, too, for a long period.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘How can that be? the handkerchiefs were lent you scarce
a quarter of an hour ago.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘I cannot deny it, sire; but what would my magic powers
avail me if I could not perform incomprehensible tricks? Your
Majesty will doubtless be still more surprised, when I prove to
your satisfaction that this coffer, as well as its contents, was deposited
in the chest of the orange-tree sixty years ago.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘I should like to believe your statement,’ the King replied,
with a smile; ‘but that is impossible, and I must, therefore, ask
for proofs of your assertion.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘If Your Majesty will be kind enough to open this casket
they will be supplied.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Certainly; but I shall require a key for that.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘It only depends on yourself, sire, to have one. Deign to
remove it from the neck of this turtle-dove, which has just
brought it to you.’</p>

<p>“Louis Philippe unfastened a ribbon that held a small rusty
key, with which he hastened to unlock the coffer.</p>

<p>“The first thing that caught the King’s eye was a parchment
on which he read the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>“&#x202f;‘This day, the 6th June, 1786,</div>
<p class="pfirst">This iron box, containing six
handkerchiefs, was placed among the roots of an orange-tree
by me, Balsamo, Count of Cagliostro, to serve in performing
an act of magic, which will be executed on the same day
sixty years hence before Louis Philippe of Orleans and his
family.’ <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“&#x202f;‘There is decidedly witchcraft about this,’
the king said, more and more amazed. ‘Nothing is wanting,
for the seal and signature of the celebrated sorcerer are
placed at the foot of this statement, which, Heaven pardon
me, smells strongly of sulphur.’</p>

<p>“At this jest the audience began to laugh.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘But,’ the king added, taking out of the box a carefully
sealed packet, ‘can the handkerchiefs by possibility be in this?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Indeed, sire, they are; but, before opening the parcel, I
would request your majesty to notice that it also bears the impression
of Cagliostro’s seal.’</p>

<p>“This seal once rendered so famous by being placed on the
celebrated alchemist’s bottles of elixir and liquid gold, I had
obtained from Torrini, who had been an old friend of Cagliostro’s.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘It is certainly the same,’ my royal spectator answered, after
comparing the two seals. Still, in his impatience to learn the contents
of the parcel, the king quickly tore open the envelope and
soon displayed before the astonished spectators the six handkerchiefs
which, a few moments before, were still on my table.</p>

<p>“This trick gained me lively applause.”</p>

<p>Robert-Houdin never revealed the secret of this remarkable
experiment in natural magic, but the acute reader, especially if he
be a student of legerdemain, will be able to give a pretty shrewd
guess as to the <i>modus operandi</i>. The best analysis of this trick
has been lately given by Professor Brander Matthews. He writes
as follows (<i>Scribner’s Magazine</i>, May, 1903):</p>

<p>“Nothing more extraordinary was ever performed by any
mere conjurer; indeed, this feat is quite as startling as any of
those attributed to Cagliostro himself, and it has the advantage
of being accurately and precisely narrated by the inventor. Not
only is the thing done a seeming impossibility, but it stands forth
the more impressively because of the spectacular circumstances
of its performance,—a stately palace, a lovely garden, the assembled
courtiers, and the royal family. The magician had to depend
on his wits alone, for he was deprived of all advantages
of his own theatre and of all possibility of aid from a confederate
mingled amid the casual spectators. <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span></p>

<p>“Robert-Houdin was justified in the gentle pride with which
he told how he had thus astonished the King of the French. He
refrained from any explanation of the means whereby he wrought
his mystery, believing that what is unknown is ever the more
magnificent. He did no more than drop a hint or two, telling
the reader that he had long possessed a cast of Cagliostro’s seal,
and suggesting slyly that when the King sent messengers out
into the garden to stand guard over the orange-tree the trick was
already done and all precautions were then futile.</p>

<p>“Yet, although the inventor chose to keep his secret, any one
who has mastered the principles of the art of magic can venture
an explanation. Robert-Houdin has set forth the facts honestly;
and with the facts solidly established, it is possible to reason
out the method employed to accomplish a deed which, at first
sight, seems not only impossible but incomprehensible.</p>

<p>“The first point to be emphasized is that Robert-Houdin was
as dexterous as he was ingenious. He was truly a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur,
capable of any sleight of hand. Nothing was simpler for
so accomplished a performer than the substitution of one package
for another, right before the eyes of all the spectators. And it
is to be remembered that although the palace was the King’s the
apparatus on the extemporized stage was the magician’s. Therefore,
when he borrowed six handkerchiefs and went up on the
stage and made them up into a package which remained on a
table in sight of everybody, we can grant without difficulty that
the package which remained in sight did not then contain the
borrowed handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>“In fact, we may be sure that the borrowed handkerchiefs
had been conveyed somehow to Robert-Houdin’s son who acted
as his assistant. When the handkerchiefs were once in the possession
of the son out of sight behind the scenery or hangings of
the stage, the father would pick up his package of blank visiting-cards
and distribute a dozen of them or a score, moving to and
fro in very leisurely fashion, perhaps going back to the stage to
get pencils which he would also give out as slowly as possible,
filling up the time with playful pleasantry, until
he should again <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
catch sight of his son. Then, and not until then, would he feel
at liberty to collect the cards and take them over to the King.
When the son had got possession of the handkerchiefs, he
would smooth them swiftly, possibly even ironing them into their
folds. Then he would put them into the parchment packet which
he would seal twice with Cagliostro’s seal. Laying this packet in
the bottom of the rusty iron casket, he would put on top the other
parchment which had already been prepared, with its adroit
imitation of Cagliostro’s handwriting. Snapping down the lid of
the casket, the lad would slip out into the corridor and steal into
the garden, going straight to the box of the appointed orange-tree.
He could do this unobserved, because no one was then suspecting
him and because all the spectators were then engaged in thinking
up odd places to which the handkerchiefs might be transported.
Already, in the long morning, probably while the royal household
was at its midday breakfast, the father or the son had loosened
one of the staples in the back of the box in which the designated
orange-tree was growing. The lad now removed this staple and
thrust the casket into the already prepared hole in the center of
the roots of the tree. Then he replaced the staple at the back of
the box, feeling certain that whoever should open the box in front
would find the soil undisturbed. This most difficult part of the
task once accomplished, he returned to the stage, or at least in
some way he signified to his father that he had accomplished his
share of the wonder, in the performance of which he was not
supposed to have any part.</p>

<p>“On seeing his son, or on receiving the signal that his son
had returned, Robert-Houdin would feel himself at liberty to collect
the cards on which various spectators had written the destinations
they proposed for the package of handkerchiefs which
was still in full sight. He gathered up the cards he had distributed;
but as he went toward the King, he substituted for those
written by the spectators others previously prepared by himself,—a
feat of sleight of hand quite within the reach of any ordinary
performer. Of these cards, prepared by himself,
he forced three <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
on the sovereign; and the forcing of cards upon a kindly monarch
would present little difficulty to a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur of Robert-Houdin’s
consummate skill.</p>

<p>“When the three cards were once in the King’s hands, the
trick was done, for Robert-Houdin knew Louis Philippe to be a
shrewd man in small matters. Therefore, it was reasonably certain
that when the King had to make a choice out of three places,
one near and easy, a second remote and difficult, and a third
both near and difficult, Louis Philippe would surely select the
third which was conveniently at hand and which seemed to be at
least as impossible as either of the others.</p>

<p>“The event proved that the conjurer’s analysis of the King’s
character was accurate: yet one may venture the opinion that the
magician had taken every needed precaution to avoid failure even
if the monarch had made another selection. Probably Robert-Houdin
had one little parchment packet hidden in advance somewhere
in the dome of the Invalides and another tucked up out of
sight in the base of one of the candelabra on the chimney-piece;
and if either of the other destinations had been chosen, the substitute
packet would have been produced and the magician would
then have offered to transport it also into the box of the orange-tree.
And thus the startling climax of the marvel would have
been only a little delayed.</p>

<p>“When so strange a wonder can be wrought under such
circumstances by means so simple, we cannot but feel
the force of Dr. Lodge’s warning that an unwavering
scepticism ought to be the attitude of all honest
investigators toward every one who professes to be able
to suspend the operation of a custom of nature. No one
of the feats attributed to Home, the celebrated medium
who plied his trade in Paris during the Second Empire,
was more abnormal than this trick of Cagliostro’s Casket,
and no one of them is so well authenticated. It may be
that certain of the customs of nature are not inexorable
and that we shall be able to discover exceptions now
and again. But the proof of any alleged exception, the
evidence in favor of any alleged violation of the custom
of nature, ought to be overwhelming.” <span class="xxpn"

<h3 class="h3mid">V.</h3>

<p>The greatest event of Houdin’s life was his embassy to
Algeria, “at the special request of the French Government, which
desired to lessen the influence of the Marabouts, whose conjuring
tricks, accepted as actual magic by the Arabs, gave them too much
influence.” He went to play off his tricks against those of Arab
priests, or holy men, and, by “greater marvels than they could
show, destroy the <i>prestige</i> which they had acquired. He so completely
succeeded that the Arabs lost all faith in the miracles of
the Marabouts, and thus was destroyed an influence very dangerous
to the French Government.” His first performance was
given at the leading theatre of Algiers, before a great assemblage
of Arabs, who had been summoned to witness the <i>soirée magique</i>,
by the mandate of the Marshall-Governor of Algeria. Houdin’s
“Light and Heavy Chest” literally paralyzed the Arabs with
astonishment. He altered the <i>mise en scène</i>, and pretended to
be able to make the strongest man so weak that he would be
unable to lift a small box from the floor. He says in his memoirs:</p>

<p>“I advanced with my box in my hand, to the center of the
‘practicable,’ communicating from the stage to the pit; then addressing
the Arabs, I said to them:</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘From what you have witnessed, you will attribute a supernatural
power to me, and you are right. I will give you a new
proof of my marvelous authority, by showing that I can deprive
the most powerful man of his strength and restore it at my will.
Any one who thinks himself strong enough to try the experiment
may draw near me.’ (I spoke slowly, in order to give the interpreter
time to translate my words).</p>

<p>“An Arab of middle height, but well built and muscular, like
many of the Arabs are, came to my side with sufficient assurance.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Are you very strong?’ I said to him, measuring him from
head to foot.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Oh yes!’ he replied carelessly.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Are you sure you will always remain so?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Quite sure.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘You are mistaken, for in an instant I will rob you of your
strength, and you shall become like as
a little child.’ <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span></p>

<p>“The Arab smiled disdainfully, as a sign of his incredulity.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Stay,’ I continued; ‘lift up this box.’</p>

<p>“The Arab stooped, lifted up the box, and said to me, ‘Is this
all?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Wait <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
 src="images/dash-2em.png" width="141"
 height="60" alt="——" />!’</span> I replied.</p>

<p>“Then with all possible gravity, I made an imposing gesture
and solemnly pronounced the words:</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Behold! you are weaker than a woman; now, try to lift
the box.’</p>

<p>“The Hercules, quite cool as to my conjuration, seized the
box once again by the handle, and gave it a violent tug, but this
time the box resisted, and spite of his most vigorous attacks,
would not budge an inch.</p>

<p>“The Arab vainly expended on this unlucky box a strength
which would have raised an enormous weight, until at length
exhausted, panting, and red with anger, he stopped, became
thoughtful, and began to comprehend the influences of magic.</p>

<p>“He was on the point of withdrawing; but that would be
allowing his weakness, and that he, hitherto respected for his
vigor, had become as a little child. This thought rendered him
almost mad.</p>

<p>“Deriving fresh strength from the encouragements his friends
offered him by word and deed, he turned a glance around them,
which seemed to say, ‘You will see what a son of the desert can
do.’</p>

<p>“He bent once again over the box: his nervous hands twined
around the handle, and his legs, placed on either side like two
bronze columns, served as a support for the final effort.</p>

<p>“But, wonder of wonders! this Hercules, a moment since so
strong and proud, now bows his head; his arms, riveted to the
box, undergo a violent muscular contraction; his legs give way,
and he falls on his knees with a yell of agony.</p>

<p>“An electric shock, produced by an induction apparatus, had
been passed, on a signal from me, from the further end of the
stage into the handle of the box. Hence the contortions of the
poor Arab!</p>

<p>“It would have been cruelty to
prolong this scene. <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span></p>

<p>“I gave a second signal, and the electric current was immediately
intercepted. My athlete, disengaged from his terrible
bondage, raised his hands over his head.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Allah! Allah’ he exclaimed, full of terror; then, wrapping
himself up quickly in the folds of his burnous, as if to hide his
disgrace, he rushed through the ranks of the spectators and
gained the front entrance.</p>

<p>“With the exception of the dignitaries occupying the stage
boxes and the privileged spectators, in the body of the house, who
seemed to take great pleasure in this great experiment, my audience
had become grave and silent, and I heard the words ‘<i>Shaitan!</i>’
‘<i>Djenoum!</i>’ passing in a murmur round the circle of credulous
men, who, while gazing on me, seemed astonished that I possessed
none of the physical qualities attributed to the angel of darkness.”</p>

<p>The Marabout priests constantly boasted of their invulnerability.
They were reputed to be possessed of powerful talismans
which caused loaded weapons to flash in the pan when fired at
them. Houdin counteracted these claims by performing his celebrated
bullet-catching feat, in which a marked bullet apparently
shot from a gun is caught by the magician in a plate or between
his teeth. There are two ways of accomplishing this trick. One
is by substituting a bullet of hollow wax for the real leaden bullet.
The explosion scatters the wax into minute fragments which
fly in all directions and do not come in contact with the person
shot at; provided he stands at a respectable distance from the
individual who handles the pistol or gun. The second method is
to insert into the barrel of the weapon a small tube open at one
end. Into this receptacle the bullet falls, and the tube is withdrawn
from the gun in the act of ramming it, forming as it
were a part of the ramrod. The performer, once in possession of
the little tube, secretly extracts the marked bullet and produces it
at the proper time. Houdin had recourse to both ways of performing
this startling trick. Sometimes he filled the wax bullet
with blood, extracted from his thumb. When the bullet smashed
against a white wall it left a red splash. Houdin, after traveling
into the interior of Algeria, visiting many prominent chieftains,
returned to France, and settled down at St.
Gervais, a suburb <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
of Blois. He relinquished his theatre to his brother-in-law,
Pierre Chocat (M. Hamilton), and devoted himself to scientific
work, and writing his <i>Confidences</i> and other works on natural
magic.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">VI.</h3>

<p>Houdin called his villa at St. Gervais the “Priory,” a rather
monastic title. It was a veritable palace of enchantments. Electrical
devices played an important part in its construction, as
well as automata. The Pepper ghost illusion was rigged up in
a small pavilion on the grounds. A mechanical hermit welcomed
guests to a grotto: Houdin’s friends jestingly called the
place “<i>L’Abbaye de l’Attrape</i> (<i>la Trappe</i>),” or “Catch’em Abbey.”
The pun is almost untranslatable. “<i>Attrape</i>” is a trap,
in French. You have a Trappist Monastery. I need say no
more. During the Franco-Prussian War, Houdin’s neighbors
brought their valuables to him to be concealed. He had a
hiding place built which defied detection. But the Prussians
never bothered him.</p>

<p>Says William Manning (<i>Recollections of Robert-Houdin</i>,
London, 1891):</p>

<p>“Robert-Houdin’s employment of electricity, not only as a
moving power for the performance of his illusions, but for domestic
purposes, was long in advance of his time. The electric
bell, so common to us now, was in every-day use <i>for years</i> in
his own house, before its value was recognized by the public.</p>

<p>“He had a favorite horse, named Fanny, for which he entertained
great affection, and christened her ‘the friend of the family.’
She was of gentle disposition and was growing old in his
service; so he was anxious to allow her every indulgence, especially
punctuality at meals and full allowance of fodder.</p>

<p>“Such being the case, it was a matter of great surprise that
Fanny grew daily thinner and thinner, till it was discovered that
her groom had a great fancy for the art formerly practised by her
master and converted her hay into five-franc pieces! So Houdin
dismissed the groom and secured a more honest lad, but to provide
against further contingencies and neglect of
duty he had <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
a clock placed in his study, which with the aid of an electrical
wire worked a food supply in the stable, a distance of fifty yards
from the house. The distributing apparatus was a square funnel-shaped
box which discharged the provender in prearranged quantities.
No one could steal the oats from the horse after they had
fallen, as the electric trigger could not act unless the stable door
was locked. The lock was outside, and if any one entered before
the horse finished eating his oats, a bell would immediately
ring in the house.</p>

<p>“This same clock in his study also transmitted the time to
two large clock-faces, placed one on the top of the house, the
other on the gardener’s lodge, the former for the benefit of the
villagers.</p>

<p>“In his bell-tower he had a clockwork arrangement of sufficient
power to lift the hammer at the proper moment. The daily
winding of the clock was performed automatically by com­mu­ni­ca­tion
with a swing-door in his kitchen, and the winding-up apparatus
of the clock in the clock-tower was so arranged that the
servants in passing backward and forward on their domestic
duties unconsciously wound up the striking movement of the
clock.”</p>

<p>The Priory is now a partial ruin. It has passed out of his
family. Houdin died there June 13, 1871, after an illness of
ten days. His death was caused by pneumonia. The following
is an extract of the notice of his decease, taken from the registers
of the civil authorities of St. Gervais:</p>

<p>“June 14, 1871. Notice of the death of Robert-Houdin,
Jean-Eugène, died at St. Gervais, June 13, 1871, at 10 P. M.,
sixty-five years of age. Son of the defunct Prosper Robert and
Marie Catherine Guillon; widower of his first wife Josephe
Cecile Eglantine Houdin; married the second time to Françoise
Marguerite Olympe Naconnier; Court House of St. Gervais,
signed—The Mayor.” The signature is illegible.</p>

<p>William Manning was an intimate friend of Houdin. When
the famous conjurer went to London to exhibit, he lodged at
the house of Manning’s father. William was a young man at
the time and deeply enamored
with conjuring exhibitions. <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
Houdin showed him many favors and presented him with a number
of souvenirs, among them being a magic clock, a harlequin-in-the-box,
etc., also a photograph of himself, a copy of which Mr.
Manning sent to me a few years ago, during the course of a
correspondence I had with him concerning Houdin. Up to the
time of his death the great conjurer exchanged letters with his
friend, then a grown man. Houdin’s closing years were saddened
by the tragic death of his son, Eugène, who was killed
at Reichshoffen in the Franco-Prussian War. He was a sub-lieutenant
in the French army and a graduate of the military
school at St. Cyr. He assisted his father on the stage, but
abandoned conjuring for a military career. In a letter to William
Manning, dated September 11, 1870, Houdin describes the
affair at Reichshoffen: .&#xa0;.&#xa0;.&#xa0;. “My son was 33 years old;
he was captain since 1866; he belonged to the 1st Zouaves and
was considered one of the bravest in that brave corps. You can
judge of it by the following extract from an article in the <i>Figaro</i>,
of Sept. 3, entitled ‘An episode of Reichshoffen,’ an extract from
a private letter. This letter was undoubtedly written by a soldier
in my son’s company; it is signed with an X. I omit the
harrowing incidents which preceded this sad retreat. .&#xa0;.&#xa0;.&#xa0;.
‘The line had received orders to break up and were defeated,
35,000 against 140,000! My company (1st Zouaves) was
drawn up on the battle-field, to be used as sharp-shooters, alone,
without artillery; we were to resist the retreat. Upon the order
of Captain Robert-Houdin, Lieutenant Girard advanced with two
men to reconnoitre the enemy. He took three steps, and fell,
crying: ’<i>Do not give up the Coucou</i>, (a familiar expression
applied to the flag). We carried him away and the Captain
shouted ‘Fire!’ The order to retreat came, but we did not hear
it, and continued to beat against a wall of fire which illuminated
our ranks. Soon our Captain fell, saying: ‘Tell them .&#xa0;.&#xa0;.
<i>that I fell facing the enemy</i>.’ A bullet had pierced his breast.
He was taken in the ambulance to Reichshoffen where he died,
four days later, from his wound.”</p>

<p>“My dear Manning, would you believe it, my brave son,
mortally wounded as he was, had the
heroic courage amidst <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
flying shot to take from his pocket a pencil and a card and to
write these words: ‘Dear father, <i>I am wounded, but be reassured,
it is only a trifle</i>.’ He could not sign this. The card
and the envelope are stained with his blood. This precious
relic was sent to me from Reichshoffen after my son’s death.”</p>

<p>Emile, the elder son who distinguished himself in the “Second-Sight
Trick,” as soon as his father retired from the stage,
became a watchmaker. He published a work on horology to
which his father wrote the following preface:</p>

<p>“I have often been asked why my son did not follow the
career I had opened for him in pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion, but preferred
instead the study of horology. My answer to the question may
be used fitly as a preface to this pamphlet.</p>

<p>“If you believe in hereditary vocations, here is a case for
their just application. My son’s maternal great-grandfather,
Nicolas Houdin, was a watchmaker of great merit in the last
century. J. F. Houdin, his son, has gained, as is well known,
a prominent place among the most distinguished watchmakers of
his time. A certain modesty, which you will understand, prevents
me from praising my father as highly; I
shall only say <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
that he was a very skilful and ingenious watchmaker. Before
devoting myself to the art of conjuring, based on mechanism, I,
too, was for a long time a watchmaker and achieved some success.</p>

<div class="dctr03"><img src="images/i157.png"
width="800" height="1200" alt="" /></div>

<p>“With such genealogy, should one not be predestined to horology?
Therefore my son was irresistibly
drawn to his <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
vocation, and he took up the art which Berthoud and Bréguet have
made famous. It was from the latter of the two celebrated masters
that he learned the elements of the profession of his forefathers.”</p>

<p>Emile was subsequently induced to take up the magic
wand, and in conjunction with Professor Brannet gave many
clever entertainments. During his management the old
theatre<a class="afnanc" href="#fn22" id="fnanc22">22</a>
in the Palais Royal was abandoned, and a new theatre
erected on the Boulevard des Italiens. He held this
property until his decease in 1883. The theatre was partly
destroyed by fire, January 30, 1901, but was rebuilt.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc22" id="fn22">22</a>
Houdin’s original theatre in the <i>Galerie de Valois</i>
of the Palais Royal has long ago been swallowed up in the
alterations made in the building. M. Trewey, in the spring of 1905,
met an old man, a former employee of the Palais, who remembered
seeing Houdin perform in 1845–46, but he could not even locate the
little theatre. How soon are the glories of the past forgotten by
a fickle public. The theatre has been divided into two or three
shops.</p></div>

<p>The only surviving members of the family are Madame Emile
Robert-Houdin, widow of the elder son, and a daughter who is
married to M. Lemaitre Robert-Houdin, a municipal officer of
Blois, who has adopted the name of Houdin. Robert-Houdin
is interred in the cemetery of Blois. A handsome monument
marks his grave.</p>

<p>At the Paris Exhibition of 1844, Houdin was awarded a
medal for the ingenious construction of automata; at the Exhibition
of 1855 he received a gold medal for his scientific application
of electricity to clocks. He invented an ophthalmoscope to
enable the operator to examine the interior of his own eye.
From important papers in the possession of M. Lemaitre it seems
more than probable that Houdin had worked out the secret of
the modern telephone before it had been made known to the
world at large.</p>

<p>Houdin has been considered of such importance and interest
in France that in Didot’s <i>Nouvelle Biographie Générale</i> a whole
page is given him. His personal appearance is thus described
in Larousse’s <i>Encyclopédie</i>: “He was a man of small stature.
His manners were engaging and vivacious. His face was clean-shaven,
showing a large and eloquent mouth.
In his old age, <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span>
his head was covered with snow white hair. His eyes up to the
last retained the fire and brilliancy of a man of twenty-five.”</p>

<p>On December 6, 1905, the French Society of Magicians celebrated
the hundredth anniversary of Houdin’s birth. The exercises
were held at the Theatre Robert-Houdin, Boulevard des
Italiens, Paris. The little theatre was crowded with conjurers
and their friends. Among the wielders of the magic staff were
Caroly, the editor of <i>Illusioniste</i>, M. and Mme. de Gago, Folletto,
M. and Mme. Talazac, and M. Raynaly. M. and Mme. Talazac,
in their “mind-reading” act, evoked great applause. M. Miliès,
the manager of the house, exhibited the automaton, “Antonio
Diavolo,” invented by Robert-Houdin. M. Renaly, the well-known
drawing-room conjurer, read a poem in honor of the
great master, at the close of which a bust of Robert-Houdin,
which stood upon the stage, was crowned with a wreath of
laurel. Strange to say, not a word of this interesting event
was recorded in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Houdin was the first conjurer to be employed in an
official capacity by a civilized Power. The second case we
have record of was on the occasion of the English Mission
to the late Sultan of Morocco when Mr. Douglas Beaufort was
appointed conjurer to the party by the British Government.
The object was to surprise the Arabs with the skill of an
Anglo-Saxon pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur. During the journey to
Fez from the coast, Mr. Beaufort gave a number of séances.
The news of his necromantic powers soon spread like
wild-fire among the natives. When the Embassy reached the
Arab Capital, the Sultan refused to see the “Devil Man,”
as he termed the conjurer. He imagined that the British
proposed to cast a spell over him. For eight weeks he held
out, but finally curiosity got the better of him. The Grand
Vizier was ordered to produce the Disciple of Beelzebub
at the Royal Palace. The performance of Mr. Beaufort so
delighted the ruler of Morocco that he presented him with a
silver dagger, a fine Arabian steed from the royal stable,
and a bag containing 500 dollars, as a token of esteem and
regard.</p></div><!--section-->

<p class="pfirst">I love to read about the old-time
conjurers, the contemporaries of Robert-Houdin, or his
immediate successors. Literature on the subject is very
sparse indeed. In his memoirs, Houdin gives us a few
thumbnail sketches of his rivals in the mystic art, and
then dismisses them with a kindly, <i>Vale</i>. He has something
to say about Bosco’s personal appearance and performances,
but makes no mention of the romantic incidents in the great
magician’s career. I shall try, in this chapter, to sketch
the lives of some of these men, basing my information on
rare <i>brochures</i> contained in the Ellison Library, and
from information picked up by Mr. Harry Houdini in Europe.
The great encyclopedic dictionary of Larousse—a monument
of French erudition—contains something about Phillippe,
Robin and Comte. Mr. Ellis Stanyon, a conjurer of London,
and author of several valuable little treatises on magic,
has kindly furnished me with interesting data; the files
of old newspapers in the British Museum, and the Library
of Congress have also been drawn upon, also the fine
collection of old programmes of Mr. Arthur Margery, the
English magician. Let us begin with</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">COMTE.</h3>

<p>Louis Apollinaire Comte was a magician of great skill, a
mimic and ventriloquist. He was born in Geneva, Switzerland,
June 22, 1788, and died at Rueil, France, November 25, 1859.
On one occasion he was denounced by some super­sti­tious Swiss
peasants as a sorcerer, set upon and beaten with
clubs, and was <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
about to be thrown into a lime kiln. His ventriloquial powers
saved his life. He caused demoniacal voices to proceed from the
kiln, whereupon his tormentors fled from the spot in affright,
imagining that they were addressed by the Powers of Darkness.</p>

<p>When summoned to appear before Louis XVIII, at the palace
of the Tuilleries, Comte arranged a clever mystification to amuse
his royal patron. During the course of the entertainment he
requested the king to select a card from a pack. By his address,
he caused the monarch to draw the king of hearts. Placing the
card in a pistol, Comte fired it at a bouquet of flowers on a table,
declaring that the pasteboard would appear in the bouquet. Immediately,
a bust of the king was seen among the flowers.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” said Louis XVIII, with a sarcastic
smile. “I fancy, sir, your trick has not ended as you stated.”</p>

<p>“I beg your Majesty’s pardon,” Comte replied, with a profound
bow. “I have quite kept my promise. I pledged myself
that the king of hearts should appear in that bouquet of flowers,
and I appeal to all Frenchmen whether that bust does not represent
<i>the king of all hearts</i>.</p>

<p>The experiment was applauded to the echo by those present.
The <i>Royal Journal</i> of the 20th of December, 1814, thus describes
the affair.</p>

<p>“The whole audience exclaimed in reply to M. Comte, ‘We
recognize him—it is he—the king of all hearts! the beloved of
the French—of the whole universe—Louis XVIII, the august
descendant of Henri Quatre?’</p>

<p>“The king, much affected by these warm acclamations, complimented
M. Comte on his skill.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘It would be a pity,’ he said to him, ‘to order such a talented
sorcerer to be burnt alive. You have caused us too much pleasure
for us to cause you pain. Live many years, for yourself in the
first place, and then for us.’&#x202f;”</p>

<p>Comte was an adept at the art of flattery. Perhaps all the
while, he and the fickle courtiers of the Tuilleries were secretly
laughing at the poor old Bourbon king, the scion of a race that
had all but ruined France, and were wishing back from Elba that
Thunderbolt of
War—Napoleon the Great. <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span></p>

<p>Comte was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by
Louis Philippe.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">PHILLIPPE.</h3>

<p>Phillippe [Talon] was born at Alais, near Nimes (France).
He carried on the trade of confectioner first in Paris, afterwards
in Aberdeen, Scotland. Failing to make a success of the sugar
business, he adopted conjuring as a profession, and was remarkably
successful. He was assisted by a young Scotchman named
Macalister, who on the stage appeared as a negro, “Domingo.”
Macalister, a clever mechanic, invented many of the best things
in Phillippe’s repertoire. From some Chinese jugglers, Phillippe
learned the gold-fish trick and the Chinese rings. With these
capital experiments added to his programme, he repaired to
Paris, in 1841, and made a great hit. Habited like a Chinaman,
he performed them in a scene called “A night in the palace of
Pekin.” The fish trick he ostentatiously named “Neptune’s Basins,
and the Gold Fish.” The bowls of water containing the
fish he produced from shawls while standing on a low table. He
followed this with a production of rabbits, pigeons, ducks, and
chickens.</p>

<p>Robert-Houdin in his memoirs, gives a brief but pointed
sketch of Phillippe. On page
163 I reproduce one of his unique
programmes (London, March, 1846).</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3mid">ROBIN.</h3>

<p>Henri Robin was a Hollander by birth, his real name being
Dunkell. He was born about 1805 and died in Paris in 1874.
Although he had appeared before the public many times and his
talents as a prestidigatateur had long been recognized, it was not
until the end of 1862, when he opened his theatre in Paris, that
he became a celebrity and a household word in the country of
his adoption. He was a man of distinguished appearance, very
urbane, and possessed of a sparkling wit. His handsome little
<i>salle de spectacle</i>, known as the
Theatre Robin,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn23" id="fnanc23">23</a>
was situated on
<span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
the Boulevard du Temple. Porcelain medallions ornamented
the walls, representing Archimides, Galileo, Palissy, Vaucanson,
Franklin, Volta, Newton, Daguerre, Arago, Cuvier, Robertson,
Humboldt, Comte, and Cagliostro. Of these great men only
Vaucanson, Robertson, and Cagliostro could properly be classed
as magicians. Vaucanson was a builder of ingenious automata;
Robertson the creator of optical illusions; and Cagliostro a pretender
to sorcery, who made use of hypnotism and phan­tas­ma­goria
in his séances. But science has its wizards, in one sense
of the word, and so Robin included the great pioneers of scientific
research among his galaxy of wonder-workers.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc23" id="fn23">23</a>
This theatre was demolished at the time of the enlargement of the
Place de Chateau d’Eau.</p></div>

<p>The journal <i>La France</i> said in its issue of January 19, 1863:
“The stage is large and square in form, the
curtain rises upon <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
a brilliantly lighted salon showing much gilding, filled with
strange objects, electrical apparatus of all sizes, mysterious chests,
revolving tables, articulated animals which as far surpass the
automatons of Vaucanson as an Everard or Pleyel piano is superior
to an old fashioned spinet. There were peacocks which
paraded up and down and could tell you the name of any city
you might think of; drums which beat the retreat without a
drummer; Christmas trees which shook their branches, powdered
with snow, and covered themselves with lighted candles, bonbons,
flowers and toys; inexhaustible bottles, invisible bells, etc.
Altogether it was the strange, supernatural and fantastic world
of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion, magic and sorcery.</p>

<hr class="hr30" />

<p>“All at once, from the bottom of a magic casket, leaped out a
harlequin about ten inches high but so well proportioned in its
figure, so well made, so nimble and supple, so intelligent and <i>spirituel</i>,
that the whole audience uttered a cry of pleasure and admiration.
This pretty little manikin does everything belonging
to its character. It dances, smokes, frisks about, takes off and
puts on its mask, bows to the company and plays the flageolet.
One is tempted to say—‘it only needs speech to be human.’ Well,
it has speech. It talks and answers all questions addressed to it
like a real person. It even tells stories, making them up as it
goes along.”</p>

<p>Besides the show of magic an “agioscope” was to be seen
which projected upon a screen the history of creation in forty-five
pictures. Robin also performed experiments in physics and
chemistry and an exhibition of the ghost illusion closed the entertainment.</p>

<p>Robin and Robert-Houdin were at odds about the inexhaustible
bottle which each claimed to have invented. Robert-Houdin
declared that he had exhibited it for the first time on December
1, 1847, while Robin produced his “Almanach of Cagliostro,”
showing the trick of the inexhaustible bottle which he declares
he had invented and exhibited for the first time July 6, 1844,
at the theatre Re at Milan. Nevertheless in
all their lectures <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
on physics, scientific men explain to their hearers the operation
of the Robert-Houdin bottle.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn24" id="fnanc24">24</a></p>

“It is remarkable how many of the illusions regarded
as the original inventions of eminent conjurers have been really
improvements of older tricks. ‘Hocus Pocus Junior,’ <i>the Anatomy
of Legerdemain</i> (4th edition, 1654), gives an explanatory cut of
a method of drawing different liquors out of a single tap in a
barrel, the barrel being divided into compartments, each having
an air-hole at the top, by means of which the liquor in any of
the compartments was withheld or permitted to flow. Robert-Houdin
applied the principle to a wine-bottle held in his hand, from
which he could pour four different liquids, regulated by the
unstopping of any of the four tiny air holes which were covered
by his fingers. A large number of very small liquor glasses being
provided on trays, and containing drops of certain flavoring
essences, enabled him to supply imitations of various wines and
liquors, according to the glasses with which he poured syrup from
the bottle.”—<i>Encyclopedia Britannica.</i></p></div>

<p>When the Davenport Brothers, pretended spiritualists, came
to Paris, Robin duplicated all their tricks at his theatre. He did
much to discredit the charlatans. About 1869 he gave up his
theatre, and became the proprietor of a hotel on the Boulevard
Mazas.</p>

<p>Robin left three works, copies of which are very rare, viz:
<i>L’Almanach Illustré de Cagliostro; Histoire des Spectres Vivants
et Impalpables; Secret de la Physique Amusante</i> (Paris, 1864).
He was also the inventor of a railroad for ascending Mount Rigi
in Switzerland. The motor in this system was a balloon which,
by its ascentional force compelled the car to climb the ascent
guided by four iron rails. A model of this contrivance was
exhibited at Robin’s theatre, 49 Boulevard du Temple.</p>

<p>I look again into the magic mirror of the past. Who is this
portly figure enveloped in a befrogged military cloak? He has
the mobile visage of an Italian. There is an air of pomposity
about him. His eyes are bold and piercing. He has something
of the appearance of a Russian nobleman, or general under the
Empire. Ah, that is the renowned Bosco, the conjurer!</p>

<div>(From a Rare Engraving in the Possession of Dr. Saram

<p>Bartolomeo Bosco had an adventurous career.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn25" id="fnanc25">25</a> He was
born in Turin, Italy, January 11, 1793. He came of a noble
family of Piedmont. At the age of nineteen he was one of
the <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span> victims
caught in the meshes of the great military drag-net of
Napoleon I, that fisher for men. In other words, he became
“food for powder” in the Russian campaign of the Emperor
of France. He was a fusilier in the 11th infantry of the
line. At the battle of Borodino, in an encounter with
Cossacks, Bosco was badly wounded in the side by a lance,
and fell upon the ground. A son of the Cossack lancer who
had wounded him, <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
dismounted and began to rifle his pockets. Like all
soldiers on a campaign, Bosco carried his fortune with
him. It did not amount to very much: a watch, a keepsake
from a sweetheart, a few gold pieces, a tobacco pouch,
etc. Fearing to receive the <i>coup de grace</i> from his
enemy, he pretended to be dead. But on realizing that if
he were robbed of his money he would be left destitute in
the world, he put his abilities as a conjurer to work and
dexterously picked the Cossack’s pocket of a well-filled
purse. It was a case of Greek meeting Greek. The Russian,
grumbling, perhaps, at the paucity of his ill-gotten
plunder, finally mounted his horse and rode away after his
comrades, to discover later on that he had been <i>done</i> and
by a corpse. Later in the day Bosco was picked up from the
battlefield by the Russian medical corps, and his wounds
treated. He was sent a captive to Siberia, near the town
of Tobolsk. His talent for <i>escamotage</i> served him well.
The long winter evenings of his captivity when the snow lay
deep upon the earth, and the wind howled about the prison
walls, were spent by him either amusing his jailors or his
fellow-soldiers. He sometimes gave exhibitions of his skill
before the high officials of the place, thereby picking
up considerable money. He spent his earnings generously
upon his poorer brethren. Finally, in April, 1814, he was
released. He returned to Italy, to the great delight of his
friends, and studied medicine. Eventually he abandoned the
art of Esculapias for the art of Trismegistus and became a
professional conjurer.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc25" id="fn25">25</a>
<i>Cabinetto magico del Cavalieri Bartolomeo Bosco de
Torino.</i> Milano, 1854.</p></div>

<p>Bosco was a wonderful performer of the cup-and-ball trick.
He also possessed great skill with cards and coins. He traveled
all over Europe. He gave an exhibition before Marie Louise,
the widow of Napoleon I, on the 27th of April, 1836. His
sonorous, bizarre name has become a byword in France for
deception, whether in conjuring or politics. The statesman
Thiers was called the “Bosco of the Tribune.” Many of Bartolomeo
Bosco’s imitators assumed his cognomen. At the present
day there is a French magician touring the music halls of
Europe, who calls himself Bosco. The original Bosco, like
Alexander Herrmann, was in the habit of advertising himself
by giving impromptu exhibitions of his skill
in cafés, stage <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
coaches, hotels, etc. He was wonderfully clever at this. A
Parisian newspaper thus announced one of his entertainments:
“The famous Bosco, who can conjure away a house as easily
as a nutmeg, is about to give his performances at Paris, in which
some miraculous tricks will be executed.” This illusion to the
nutmeg has reference to the magician’s cup-and-ball trick; nutmegs
frequently being used instead of cork balls. Houdin describes
Bosco’s stage as follows:</p>

<p>“I entered the little theatre and took my seat. According to
the idea I had formed of a magician’s laboratory, I expected to
find myself before a curtain whose large folds, when withdrawn,
would display before my dazzled eyes a brilliant stage ornamented
with apparatus worthy of the celebrity announced; but my illusions
on this subject soon faded away.</p>

<p>“A curtain had been considered superfluous, and the stage
was open. Before me was a long three-storied sideboard, entirely
covered with black serge. This lugubrious buffet was adorned
with a number of wax candles, among which glistened the apparatus.
At the topmost point of this strange <i>étagère</i> was a
death’s-head, much surprised, I have no doubt, at finding itself
at such a festival, and it quite produced the effect of a funeral
service.</p>

<p>“In front of the stage, and near the spectators, was a table
covered by a brown cloth, reaching to the ground, on which
five brass cups were symmetrically arranged. Finally, above this
table hung a copper ball, which strangely excited my curiosity.</p>

<p>“For the life of me I could not imagine what this was for, so
I determined to wait till Bosco came to explain it. The silvery
sound of a small bell put an end to my reverie, and Bosco appeared
upon the stage.</p>

<p>“The artiste wore a little black velvet jacket, fastened round
the waist by a leathern belt of the same color. His sleeves were
excessively short, and displayed a handsome arm. He had on
loose black trousers, ornamented at the bottom with a ruche of
lace, and a large white collar round his neck. This strange attire
bore considerable resemblance to the classical costume of the
Scapins in our plays. <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span></p>

<p>“After making a majestic bow to his audience, the celebrated
conjurer walked silently and with measured steps up to the
famous copper ball. After convincing himself it was solidly
hung, he took up his wand, which he wiped with a white handkerchief,
as if to remove any foreign influence; then, with imperturbable
gravity, he struck the ball thrice with it, pronouncing,
amid the most solemn silence, this imperious sentence: <i>Spiriti
mei infernali, obedite</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span></p>

<p>“I, like a simpleton, scarce breathed in my expectation of some
miraculous result, but it was only an innocent pleasantry, a
simple introduction to the performance with the cups.”</p>

<p>After many wanderings Bartolomeo Bosco laid down his
magic wand in Dresden, March 2, 1862. He lies buried in a
cemetery on Friederichstrasse. Mr. Harry Houdini, the American
conjurer, located the grave on October 23, 1903. Upon the
tombstone is carved the insignia of Bosco’s profession—a cup-and-ball
and a wand. They are encircled by a wreath of laurel.
Says Mr. Houdini, in a letter to <i>Mahatma</i>: “I found the
head of the wand missing. Looking into the tall grass near
by I discovered the broken tip.” This relic he presented to Dr.
Saram R. Ellison, of New York (1904). The tombstone bears
the following inscription: <i>Ici répose le célèbre Bartolomeo
Bosco&#x2009;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x2009;Ne à Turin le 11 Janvier, 1793; décédé à Dresden le 2 Mars,
1862.</i> Madame Bosco was interred in the same grave with her
husband, but no mention of her is made on the stone. The small
plot of ground where the grave is situated was leased for a term
of years. That term had long expired when Mr. Houdini discovered
the last resting place of Bosco. It was offered for sale.
In the event of its purchase the remains of the conjurer and his
wife would have been transferred to a section of the cemetery set
apart for the neglected dead. But Houdini prevented all future
possibility of this by buying the lot in fee. He then deeded it
to the Society of American Magicians.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">ANDERSON.</h3>

<p>John Henry Anderson was born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland,
July 14, 1814. He began life as an actor. After witnessing a
performance in England by Signor Blitz, his mind was struck
with the resources of magic as a means of entertaining the public,
and adding to his own exchequer. So he abandoned the
histrionic stage for conjuring, though he occasionally performed
in melodrama as a side issue. He was very fine in the title rôle
of “Rob Roy,” and as William, in “Black-eyed Susan.” His
professional sobriquet in his early career was that of the “Calidonian
Necromancer.” On one occasion he
gave an exhibition <span class="xxpn" id="p172">{172}</span>
of his skill at Abbotsford, and the genial Sir Walter Scott said
to him, “They call <i>me</i> the ‘Wizard of the North,’ but this is
a mistake—it is you, not I, who best deserve the title.” Mr.
Anderson was not slow in adopting the suggestion of the Wizard
of the Pen, and ever after called himself the Great Wizard of the
North.</p>

<div class="dctr01"><img src="images/i172.jpg"
width="800" height="875" alt="" /></div>

<p>He displayed a great collection of apparatus, which he described
as “a most gorgeous and costly apparatus of solid silver,
the mysterious mechanical construction of which is upon a secret
principle, hitherto unknown in Europe.” He claimed to have
been the inventor of the gun trick, but this was not so, as
Torrini and others exhibited it on the Continent
in the latter <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
part of the 18th century. All that Anderson did was to invent
his own peculiar method of working the illusion. “The extraordinary
mystery of the trick,” he said, “is not effected by the
aid of any accomplice, or by inserting a tube in the muzzle of
the gun, or by other conceivable devices (as the public frequently,
and in some instances, correctly imagine), but any gentleman may
really load the gun in the usual manner, inserting, himself, a
marked real leaden ball! The gun being then fired off at the
Wizard, he will instantly produce and exhibit the same bullet
in his hand.” The marked leaden bullet, however, was exchanged
for one composed of an amalgam of tinfoil and quicksilver, which
was as heavy as lead, but was broken into bits and dispersed in
firing. He once played a private engagement at the Winter
Palace, St. Petersburg, before the Czar Nicholas and a brilliant
audience of Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses. His exhibition
of second sight was an excellent one. He was asked by the
Czar to describe the watch he had in his pocket. To the profound
astonishment of the Emperor, Anderson announced that
it was encircled with one hundred and twenty brilliants around
its face, and a portrait on enamel of the Emperor Paul at the
back. He also said that the watch carried by the Empress did
not go, which was a fact, it being a very old one, a relic of Peter
the Great. It was only worn as an ornament. The wizard never
claimed supernatural powers. He undoubtedly obtained his information
about the chronometers from some member of the
Czar’s household, and worked upon the imag­i­na­tion and credulity
of the spectators.</p>

<p>Anderson had an indomitable spirit which no misfortune
could daunt. He received the “bludgeonings of Fate” like a
hero, and was “Captain of his soul” through a thousand and one
vicissitudes of life. He built on Glasgow Green one of the largest
theatres in Scotland, and it was burnt to the ground, three
months after its erection. A fortune was lost in the terrible
fire. In 1851 he came to America and met with unbounded success.
Returning to England in 1856, he engaged Covent Garden
Theatre. In March of that year this great play-house was destroyed
by fire, and Anderson lost his
splendid and costly <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
apparatus. On top of this disaster came the bankruptcy of the
Royal British Bank, and that event completely swallowed up the
remains of the wizard’s fortune. But he was undaunted. Borrowing
funds from his friends, he bought new paraphernalia, and
toured the world. After an absence of five years he returned to
England, January 11, 1863. He had traveled 235,000 miles and
“had passed through his hands the enormous sum of £157,000
sterling.” He died at Darlington, Scotland, on Tuesday, February
3, 1874. In accordance with a wish expressed during his
last illness, he was buried at Aberdeen, in the same grave with
his beloved mother. No inscription on the tombstone records
the fact that the Wizard of the North lies beneath.</p>

<p>What was the secret of Anderson’s success?</p>

<p>He was not a great magician in the sense of the word—that
is to say, an adept at legerdemain, an original creative genius like
Houdin, Robin, and the elder Herrmann. But he was an actor
who played the role of necromancer with great effect. He surrounded
himself with costly and brilliant apparatus which dazzled
the eyes of the groundlings. His baggage weighed tons and
filled many trunks and boxes. He believed in heavy artillery, like
Napoleon I. The dashing Hussar style was not his. That
branch of conjuring belongs to Frikell and De Kolta. Strange
to say, in spite of the revolution in the art of magic since Anderson’s
day, we are coming back to the big paraphernalia of the
old school. The public is tired of small tricks. A discussion
of this subject will be found in the article on Frikell.</p>

<p>I doubt whether a greater advertiser than Anderson ever
lived. Bosco cannot be compared to him. Alexander Herrmann
depended on his social qualities and his laughable adventures in
street cars, cafés, and clubs to boom his reputation. Anderson
adopted the methods of the patent-medicine manufacturers. He
would have made an excellent advance agent for a new panacea.
He literally plastered the streets and walls of London with his advertising
devices. Some of them were highly ingenious and
amusing and kept the public on the <i>qui vive</i> with excitement.
In this line of puffing, people are willing to overlook charlatanry.
One of his posters was a caricature imitation
of the famous <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
painting, “Napoleon’s Return from Elba.” It was of gigantic size.
Houdin describes it and other advertising schemes as follows:</p>

<p>“In the foreground Anderson was seen affecting the attitude
of the great man; above his head fluttered an enormous banner,
bearing the words ‘The Wonder of the World,’ while, behind
him, and somewhat lost in the shade, the Emperor of Russia and
several other monarchs stood in a respectful posture. As in the
original picture, the fanatic admirers of the Wizard embraced his
knees, while an immense crowd received him triumphantly. In
the distance could be seen the equestrian statue of the Iron Duke,
who, hat in hand, bowed before him, the Great Wizard; and,
lastly, the very dome of St. Paul’s bent towards him most humbly.</p>

<p>“At the bottom was the inscription,</p>

<div class="fsz6">‘RETURN OF THE NAPOLEON OF NECROMANCY.’</div>

<p>“Regarded seriously, this picture would be found a puff in
very bad taste: but, as a caricature, it is excessively comic. Besides,
it had the double result of making the London public laugh,
and bringing a great number of shillings into the skillful puffer’s
pockets.</p>

<p>“When Anderson is about to leave a town where he has exhausted
all his resources, and has nothing more to hope, he still
contrives to make one more enormous haul.</p>

<p>“He orders from the first jeweller in the town a silver vase,
worth twenty or twenty-five pounds; he hires, for one evening
only, the largest theatre or room in the town, and announces that
in the Wizard’s parting performance the spectators will compete
to make the best pun.</p>

<p>“The silver vase is to be the prize of the victor.</p>

<p>“A jury is chosen among the chief people of the town to decide
with the public on the merits of each pun.</p>

<p>“It is agreed that they will applaud if they think a pun good;
they will say nothing to a passable one, but groan at a bad one.</p>

<p>“The room is always crowded, for people come less to see the
performance, which they know by heart, than to display their wit
publicly. Each makes his jest, and receives a greeting more or
less favorable; and, lastly, the vase is decreed to the cleverest
among them. <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span></p>

<p>“Any other than Anderson would be satisfied with the enormous
receipts his performance produces; but the Great Wizard of
the North has not finished yet. Before the audience leaves the
house he states that a short-hand writer has been hired by him to
take down all the puns, and that they will be published as a Miscellany.</p>

<p>“As each spectator who has made a joke likes to see it in print,
he purchases a copy of the book for a shilling. An idea of the
number of these copies may be formed from the number of puns
they contain. I have one of these books in my possession, printed
in Glasgow in 1850, in which there are 1091 of these facetiæ.”</p>

<p>Here is one of Anderson’s typical programmes, dated 1854:</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">BLITZ.</h3>

<p>Signor Antonio Blitz was born June 21, 1810, in a little village
of Moravia. At an early age he picked up, unknown to anyone,
“a few adroit tricks from certain gypsies, who visited his native
town.” He began to exhibit these feats for the amusement
of himself and friends. He made his professional début at Hamburg
when but thirteen years of age, and was known to the public
as the “mysterious boy.” His first appearance in this country
was at the Music Hall, Broadway, New York. He had many
imitators. Not less than thirteen people traveled the United
States using his name, circulating a verbatim copy of his handbill
and advertisement—“not only assuming to be the <i>original</i>
Blitz, but in many instances claiming to be a son or nephew.”
“I have been,” says Blitz, in his memoirs, <i>Fifty Years in the
Magic Circle</i>, (Hartford, Conn., 1871), “in constant receipt of
bills of their contracting, for, not content with taking my name,
they have not even honor enough to pay their debts.” The thirteen
impostors exhibited under the following and other names:</p>

<ul class="ulparagraph"><li>Signor Blitz.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, Jr.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, The Original.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz’s Son.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz’s Nephew.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, The Wonderful.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, The Great.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, The Unrivalled.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, The Mysterious.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, By Purchase.</li>
<li>Signor Blitz, The Great Original.</li>
</ul>

<p>Blitz was not only a magician, but a ventriloquist and trainer
of birds. He relates an amusing encounter with the great but
eccentric genius, the Italian violinist, Paganini, whose romantic
life is known to all lovers of music. The adventure took place
in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, where Paganini was giving
a concert. Says Blitz: “He, Paganini, was tall and awkward-looking,
cadaverous in features, ungainly in
form, with long <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
black hair, said to be very wealthy, and characterized as extremely
penurious. No instance was ever known of his contributing
a penny to the distressed, or to a benevolent institution. One
morning I called and found him quietly seated in his room
alone. After conversing with him a short time I noticed his
violin case lying upon the table, when suddenly the cry of a
child issued from therein.</p>

<div class="section">
<div><span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span></div>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Who is that?’ said Paganini, quickly looking around.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘It is <i>me</i>, with the babe,’ answered a womanly voice.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘My God! what is this?’ inquired the astonished violinist.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘You well know,’ plaintively answered the woman, at the
same time the infant again commenced crying.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘We know you are a bad woman,’ vehemently declared the
excited man.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘And did you not make me so, you old Italian fiddler?’</p>

<p>“After this there was apparently a commotion in the box,
when Paganini became alarmed and was about to leave the room
when I unmasked myself and explained that he had been a victim
to the vagaries of ventriloquism; which, on hearing, delighted
him prodigiously, and grasping me by the hand he exclaimed,
‘Bravo, Signor!—bravo!’&#x202f;”</p>

<p>Signor Blitz retired from the stage with a fortune and settled
in Philadelphia. His home was on Green street near 18th
street. He taught magic and gave private entertainments for
some years before his death, which took place February, 1877.
One of his daughters was the famous opera singer, Madame
Vanzant, who at the present writing lives in Europe. These facts
I obtained from Mr. Thomas Yost.</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">ALEXANDER.</h3>

<p>Alexander Heimbürger was born December 4, 1819, in Germany.
He performed under the <i>nom de théâtre</i> of Herr Alexander.
He toured Europe, North and South America with great
success for a number of years, and retired to his native land with
a large fortune. He is at present residing at Munster, an old man
of eighty-four, with snow-white hair and beard, and bent over
with age. He was long supposed to be dead by the fraternity of
magicians, but Mr. Houdini, in his tour of Germany in 1903,
discovered that he still lived, and his whereabouts. Alexander had
many strange stories to relate of his adventures in America and
other places. He was personally acquainted with Houdin, Frikell,
Bosco, Anderson, Blitz, the original Bamberg of Amsterdam, etc.
He performed several times at the White House before President
Polk, and hobnobbed with Henry Clay,
Webster and Calhoun. <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span>
With letters from Polk he visited Brazil, and was admitted into
the most aristocratic circles. On leaving New York in 1847 he
was presented with a heavy gold medal, cast in the United States
Mint at Washington. This medal has his portrait on one side,
and on the reverse the following inscription:</p>

<p>“Presented to Herr Alexander as a token of esteem from his
friends. New York, 1847.”</p>

<div class="dctr05"><img src="images/i181.jpg"
width="348" height="453" alt="" /><div class="dcaption">
<span class="smcap">A<b>LEXANDER</b></span>
<span class="smcap">H<b>EIMBÜRGER.</b></span></div></div>

<p>Mr. Houdini writes as follows about the old magician (<i>Mahatma</i>,
June, 1903): “He was a welcome guest at the Palace of
the King of Brazil. He showed me letters to him from King
Pedro II and his wife, dated Brazil, 1850. After an absence
of ten years from his native country he returned, and married.
He is blessed with six children, two sons
and four daughters. <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
One is in New York at the present time. While in New York,
Alexander was approached by an illusionist named Orzini, who
had a cabinet of mystery. He was in hard circumstances and
came to Alexander for assistance. The genial German gave him
ten dollars. Orzini secured an engagement at the Park Theatre,
but alas, only played one night, as his act did not suit, so he was
closed after his first performance. Said Alexander to me, and
the statement caused me infinite surprise: ‘This Orzini was the
man who threw the bomb at Napoleon III in Paris, trying to kill
the Emperor, but was himself killed; also blowing up several
bystanders, and wounding the horses of Napoleon’s carriage.
The reporters discovered that Orzini had just arrived from
America, and in his lodgings they found some kind of a mysterious
glass house, which must have been the Illusion Cabinet.
In this affair Napoleon escaped with his life and a few
scratches.’&#x202f;”</p>

<p>This is a strange story. I am of the opinion that Herr Alexander
is laboring under a mistake in trying to identify the illusionist
Orzini with the celebrated revolutionist Orsini. In the
first place, there is the different spelling of the names—“Orzini”
and “Orsini”; but Mr. Houdini may have incorrectly reported
Alexander in this respect. There is no record of Orsini having
come to the United States. Again, he was not killed in the
attempted assassination of Napoleon III, in the rue Lepelletier,
Paris, January 14, 1858. He was captured and suffered imprisonment,
and was guillotined March 13, 1858. While in prison
he wrote his memoirs.</p>

<p>Herr Alexander is the author of a work entitled <i>Der Moderne
Zauberer</i> (“The Modern Magician”).</p>

<div>(As Exhibited Before Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle.)</div>
</div></div>

<p>Wiljalba Frikell was born in Scopio, a village of Finland,
in 1818. His family was well-to-do and gave him advantages
in the way of education. He graduated at the High School of
Munich in 1840, in his twenty-second year. During his scholastic
days he became interested in legerdemain, and read with
avidity every work on the subject he could
find. He attended <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{183}</span>
the performances of all conjurers who came to Munich. Refusing
to study for one of the learned professions, greatly to the
disappointment of his parents, he went on the stage, and visited
the principal cities of Europe, after which he journeyed to Egypt.
In the land of the pyramids Frikell had the honor of performing
before Mehemit Ali, who presented him with a gold medal.
Returning to Europe he visited Greece, Italy, and Spain. Subsequently
he went to India and investigated the thaumaturgy
of the fakirs. He made his first appearance in London in 1851,
and performed before Queen Victoria and the Royal Family,
at Windsor Castle. His broken German and peculiarity of manner
caused him to be described by <i>Punch</i> as “a comic Charles
Matthews.” The same journal also compared him to “a monster
raven in full dress for evening party.” His success was marked.
The Czar of Russia presented Frikell with a diamond ring of
great value, and the King of Denmark made him a Knight of
Dannebrog. Just when this remarkable man retired from the
stage I have been unable to ascertain. In his old
age he became <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
a recluse and denied himself to visitors. In fact, it was supposed
by the profession that he was dead, until Mr. Houdini discovered
his whereabouts in Krotschenbroda, a few miles from Dresden,
Germany, February, 1903, and called at his villa, but did not
succeed in obtaining an interview. Nine months later Frikell
died. He contemplated writing his memoirs <i>à la</i> Robert-Houdin,
but, alas, death cut short the undertaking. That they would
have been extremely entertaining and full of curious incidents
of travel, admits of no doubt. An extract from a letter written
by Mr. Houdini to his American friend, H. S. Thompson, of
Chicago, will prove of interest to the reader.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="psignature">“Dresden, Oct. 20, 1903.</p>

<p>“I have some news for you that may be of interest. You may remember
that I sought an interview last February with Dr. Wiljalba Frikell, but was
unable to meet him. Since then we have been in correspondence, and he
wrote me that if I ever came to Dresden he would be pleased to see me. On
arriving in Dresden I sent him word that I would call upon him on October
10th last. I accordingly went to the Villa Frikell about 1 o’clock, and
you can imagine with what sorrow and astonishment I learned that Dr.
Frikell had died of heart failure three hours before. He was awaiting my
arrival at the time. Fate willed it that I should see Herr Frikell, but that
we should not speak to each other.</p>

<p>“He was buried on October 13th. I attended the funeral and laid two
large wreaths on his grave; one on behalf of the Society of American Magicians,
and the other from myself. The S. A. M. wreath was the largest and
handsomest there.</p>

<p>“Herr Frikell was 87 years old and had made all arrangements to live
to 100. He always claimed he would live to over 100 years and would tell
why he expected to reach that age. Too bad we could not have held a conversation
ere he departed this life.</p>

<p class="psignature"><span id="sp184">“Sincerely yours,</span></p>

<p class="psignature"><span class="smcap">“H<b>ARRY</b></span>
<span class="smcap">H<b>OUDINI.”</b></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Frikell was an innovator in the art of magic. He dispensed
with apparatus. In his <i>Lessons in Magic</i>, he says: “The
use of complicated and cumbersome apparatus, to which modern
conjurers have become addicted, not only greatly diminishes
the amount of astonishment they are enabled to produce,—a
defect which is not compensated by the external splendor and
imposing effect of such paraphernalia,—but the useful lesson,
how fallible our senses are, by means the most ordinary and at
everybody’s command, is entirely lost. It has
been my object <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
in my performances to restore the art to its original province,
and to extend that to a degree which it has, I believe, never yet
hitherto reached. I banish all such mechanical and scientific
preparations from my own practice, confining myself for the
most part to the objects and materials of every day life. The
success I have met with emboldens me to believe that I have
followed the right path.”</p>

<p>There is more or less truth in what Frikell says. But one
can go to extremes in the avoidance of magic paraphernalia.
The happy course is the middle one—a combination of sleight
of hand and apparatus. I quote, as follows, from an article by
Prof. Hoffmann (<i>Mahatma</i>): “The scientific school of conjuring,
of which Robert-Houdin was the originator, had its drawbacks.
It involved the use of costly and cumbersome paraphernalia,
which grew and grew in quantity, till we find Anderson,
the Wizard of the North, traveling with seven tons of luggage!
Further, a trick, which, like Robert-Houdin’s automatic figures,
obviously depends upon ingenious mechanism, palls upon the
spectator. Such figures, at the present day, would be no more regarded
as magic than the Strasburg clock. Lastly his electrical
tricks produced an extraordinary effect, because very few persons
in his day were acquainted with the properties of electricity,
but now that there are electric bells in every household,
and electrical motor cars in every street, its magical prestige
exists no longer.</p>

<p>“Hence a reaction to a severer and simpler school of conjuring,
of which Wiljalba Frikell was the earliest exponent, the
school which professes, so far as the public is concerned, to
work without apparatus and which in fact reduces its apparatus
to the smallest possible dimensions. Many high class performers
now give what is known in England as a ‘carpet bag’ show, and
will keep an audience wonder bound for a couple of hours, using
no more apparatus than can be carried in an ordinary gripsack.</p>

<p>“Broadly speaking this is undoubtedly an advance, for of two
performers, the one who can produce by the magic of his own
fingers the same degree of illusion for which the other needs
elaborate apparatus, the former is surely the
greater artist. But
<span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
the striving for simplicity may be overdone. The performer
is apt to lose his feeling for breadth of effect, and to fritter away
his skill over illusions too minute and too soon over to make any
permanent impression. One of the most skilful sleight of hand
performers we have ever seen throws away half the value of
his work by going too fast, and producing small effects, individually
brilliant, so rapidly that his audience has not time fairly
to appreciate one before another is presented. The spectator,
under such circumstances, takes away with him a mere blurred
impression, rather than a clear mental photograph of what he has
seen, and the show suffers in his estimation accordingly.</p>

<p>“Another danger attending the non-apparatus school lies in
the fact that the performer is apt, by carrying the principle
to needless lengths, unduly to limit his methods.</p>

<p>“On the whole we are inclined to think that the most successful
magician of the future will be one who judiciously combines
apparatus and non-apparatus tricks; such apparatus, however,
to be of a simple and homely kind and not made admittedly
for the purpose of the trick. The ideal entertainment, from the
standpoint of the spectator, will be one in which feats of dexterity
or supposed dexterity, are worked in conjunction with
brilliant stage effects of a more spectacular kind, such as are
exhibited by Mr. Maskelyne at the Egyptian Hall, London.”</p>

<p>And so I ring down the curtain on the old-time conjurers.
They played their parts in the great drama of life, and enriched
the history of the stage with their adventures. What could be
more romantic than the career of the incomparable Bosco?</p>

<p>The pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur makes things appear and disappear to our
great wonderment, until finally Death, the greatest of all necromancers,
waves his wand, and the mortal fades away from view,
amid the shadows of the tomb. Tom Masson, that charming

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">
I went on one occasion to dine with Mr. Francis J. Martinka, and while
waiting for the repast to be served, seated myself upon an old-fashioned
sofa in his drawing-room.</p>

<div class="dctr01"><img src="images/i188.jpg"

<p>“Pardon me,” said my host, gaily, “while I put a bottle of
wine on ice. I will be back in a little while. In the meantime,
you may amuse yourself looking over these photos of eminent
conjurers. And, by the way, you are seated on
the very sofa <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
which Robert Heller used in his second-sight trick. Examine
it carefully and you will see where the wires and electric battery
were located. I came into possession of the relic after the death
of Heller.”</p>

<p>So saying he went out to look after the wine.</p>

<p>And so the piece of furniture I was seated on was the veritable
up-to-date tripod of that High Priestess of Delphi, Miss
Haidie Heller, who assisted Robert Heller, acting the part of
clairvoyant. It called up a flood of memories to me.</p>

<p>The magician of the Arabian Nights transported himself
from Bagdad to Damascus upon a piece of carpet. In imag­i­na­tion
that old sofa carried me back thirty years into the past. I
was seated in the gallery of the old National Theatre, Washington,
D. C., at a <i>soirée magique</i> of the famous Heller. I shall
never forget his second-sight trick. It was the most wonder-provoking,
the most mysterious experiment I have ever seen.
In his hands, it was perfect. Robert Heller saw Houdin give an
exhibition of this feat of mental magic in London. His acute
mind divined the secret, and he set about devising a code for
working the experiment. He added many new effects. Nothing
seemed to puzzle him and his assistant.</p>

<p>At an entertainment given in Boston, and described by
Henry Hermon in his work on Hellerism, a coin was handed to
Heller. He glanced at it and requested Miss Heller to name
the object.</p>

<p>“A coin,” she quickly answered.</p>

<p>“Here, see if you can tell the name of the country, and all
about it?” he next asked.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation she replied: “It is a large
copper coin—a coin of Africa, I think. Yes, it is of Tripoli.
The inscriptions on it are in Arabic; one side reads ‘Coined at
Tripoli;’ the other side, ‘Sultan of two lands, Sultan by inheritance,
and the son of a Sultan.’&#x202f;”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Heller, “that is correct. But look, what
is the date, now?”</p>

<p>“The date is 1‐2‐2‐0, one thousand two hundred and twenty
of the Hegira, or Mohammedan year, which corresponds to 1805
of the Christian year.” <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span></p>

<p>Tremendous applause greeted this feat.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred Hunt, who was for a number of years Robert Heller’s
assistant, revealed the secret of second sight soon after
Heller’s death. The performer has first to be initiated into a new
alphabetical arrangement, which is as follows:</p>

<p>A is H; B is T; C is S; D is G; E is F; F is E; G is A; H is
I; I is B; J is L; K is Pray; L is C; M is O; N is D; O is V;
P is J; Q is W; R is M; S is N; T is P; U is Look; V is Y; W
is R; X is See this; Y is Q; Z is Hurry. “Hurry up” means to
repeat the last letter. For example, the initials or name in a ring
is wanted. Say it is “Anna.” By the alphabetical arrangement
H stands for A. D for N. The exclamation “Hurry up” always
means a repetition of the last letter, and again H will give the
answer when put as follows:</p>

<p>“Here is a name. Do you see it? Hurry up. Have you
got it?”</p>

<p>Attention is paid only to the first letter of every sentence,
and it will be perceived that the name of Anna is spelled.</p>

<p>After the alphabet we have the numbers, which are arranged
as follows: 1 is Say or Speak; 2 is Be, Look or Let; 3 is Can or
Can’t; 4 is Do or Don’t; 5 is Will or Won’t; 6 is What; 7 is
Please or Pray; 8 is Are or Ain’t; 9 is Now; 10 is Tell; 0 is
Hurry or Come. “Well” is to repeat the last figure. Now for
an example: The number 1,234 is needed. The conjurer
remarks: “<i>Say</i> the number. <i>Look</i> at it. <i>Can</i> you see it? <i>Do</i>
you know?”</p>

<p>Suppose the number called for is 100.</p>

<p>“<i>Tell</i> me the number. <i>Hurry</i>!”</p>

<p>So much, dear reader, for the spelling of proper names and
conveying numbers to the clairvoyant on the stage. In regard
to colors, metals, precious stones, countries, materials, fabrics,
makers of watches, playing cards, society emblems, coins, bills,
jewelry, wearing apparel, surgical instruments, etc., etc., Heller
had them arranged in sets of ten. The first question he asked
gave the clue to the set; the second question to the number of
the article in the set. Thus but two short questions were necessary
to elicit the proper reply
from the assistant. <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
Miscellaneous articles were divided into nineteen sets. I will give examples
of two:</p>

<p>Supposing a spectator handed a <i>Rosary</i> to the conjurer. He
would call out to his assistant, “<i>What is this?</i>” (Clue to the
second set.) Then he would exclaim, “<i>Are</i> you ready?” The
word <i>are</i> would give the clue to number 8. And so on.</p>

<p>The clues to the sets were worded very nearly alike, so as to
make the spectators believe that the same questions were being
constantly asked.</p>

<p>Evoking the aid of electricity, Robert Heller was enabled
to convey the cue words and numbers of the sets to Miss Heller
<i>without speaking a word</i>. It was this wonderful effect that so
puzzled everybody. A confederate sat among the spectators,
near the center aisle of the theatre, and the wires of an electric
battery were connected with his chair, the electric push button
being under the front part of his seat. Heller gave the cue to
the set in which the article was, its number, etc., by some natural
movement of his body or arms; and the confederate, rapidly
interpreting the secret signals, telegraphed them to the clairvoyant
on the stage. The receiving instrument was attached
to the sofa upon which Miss Heller sat. The interchangeable
use of the two methods of conveying information—spoken and
unspoken—during an evening, completely bewildered the spectators.
It was indeed a sphinx problem.</p>

<p>Robert Heller, or William Henry Palmer, was born in Canterbury,
England, in 1833. At the age of fourteen he won a
scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. In
the year 1852 <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span>
he made his début in New York City at the Chinese Assembly
Rooms. On this occasion he wore a black wig and spoke
with a Gallic accent, believing that a French conjurer would be
better received in this country than an English magician. He
failed to make a success, and eventually drifted to Washington,
where he taught music for a number of years. All this time
he was perfecting himself in legerdemain. Finally he reappeared
in New York and won unbounded success. He visited Europe
and India, returning to the United States in 1875. His last
performance was given at Concert Hall, Philadelphia, on November
25, 1878. He died in the same city on November 28, 1878.
Soon after his death an absurd story went the
rounds of the <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span>
press that he had directed his executors to destroy his automata
and magical paraphernalia. Such is not the case. Mr. Francis
J. Martinka, of New York, possesses a number of his tricks.
Heller was a magnificent pianist and always gave a short recital
of his own compositions and those of the masters during his
entertainment. He used to append the following effusion to his
posters:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpp00">But the greatest is Heller.”</div>

<p>The following is one of Heller’s programmes (Salt Lake
City, Utah, May 23, 1867):</p>

<p>A curious exhibition of silent second sight was that of the
Svengali trio. The effect as described by the <i>New York Herald</i>,
August 11, 1904, is as follows:</p>

<p>“Two persons (lady and gentleman) are on the stage, both
with their backs toward the audience. A third one goes into the
auditorium, with his back towards the stage, to receive the wishes
of the audience. If the name of any international celebrity is
whispered to him, with lightning rapidity the thought is
transmitted. The gentleman on the stage turns round immediately
and appears in features, bearing and dress as the desired
personage—with wonderfully startling resemblance.</p>

<p>“One can likewise whisper to the gentleman in the auditorium
the name of an international opera, operetta or international
song. The thought flies like lightning, and the lady sings what
is wanted, instantly accompanying herself on the piano.</p>

<p>“The secret of this trick is as follows: When the curtain
rises, the master of ceremonies walks to the front of the stage
and in a pleasing voice begins: ‘Ladies and gentlemen—I have
the pleasure of introducing to you, etc., etc. I will call your
attention to the fact that the spectators must confine their whispered
wishes to international celebrities, names of well-known
personages, songs and operas of international fame,’ etc.</p>

<p>“This limitation of choice is the key to the performance.
They have lists of these ‘international celebrities,’ rulers, statesmen,
diplomats, great writers and musical composers; songs of
world-wide reputation, popular selections from the operas, etc.
And the secret of the evening is that all of these carefully selected
names, titles, etc., are numbered, as in the following examples:</p>

<ul class="ulparagraph fsz6">
<li><span class="smmaj">STATESMEN AND RULERS.</span>

<h4>HOW THE SIGNALS ARE CONCEALED.</h4>

<p>“The manager reiterates that if only names of in­ter­na­tional
rep­u­ta­tion are given the re­sponses will be cor­rect nine hundred
and ninety-nine times in a thousand. Then he descends from the
stage, and, smiling right and left, inclines his ear to catch the
whispered wishes as he moves slowly up the aisle, generally with
his back to the stage. An auditor whispers to him, ‘Bismarck.’</p>

<p>“Herr Svengali, gesticulating freely but naturally, pressing
his eyes with his fingers for an instant as if going into a momentary
trance—only a second or two, just enough to impress the
audience—then thrusts a hand into the air, wipes the moisture
from his face with his handkerchief or leans toward a spectator,
seeking his attention, when a voice from the stage says, ‘Bismarck.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Right,’ responds the man who whispered that illustrious
name. Then there is a craning of necks and crushing of programmes,
all eyes fixed on the stage, where the impersonator,
standing before a cabinet of costume pigeonholes, with the aid
of an assistant has donned wig and uniform in his lightning
change and whirls around disguised as Bismarck, while the girl
at the piano plays ‘The Watch on the Rhine.’ It is all the work
of a few seconds and makes a great impression upon the spectator.</p>

<p>“The next man calls for an opera air, ‘Bohemian Girl,’ and
the piano plays ‘I Dreamt That I Dwelt in Marble Halls,’ etc.
Another man suggests the magic name ‘Sheridan.’ It is echoed
aloud from the stage, while the audience applauds and the girl
plays ‘The Star Spangled Banner.’</p>

<p>“The few experts present pay little attention to the stage.
Their eyes are fixed on the man Svengali in the aisle, noting
every move he makes. It is observed that his numerous gestures,
his frequent use of his handkerchief, the
pressure of his <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
fingers on his eyes, as if to hypnotize his assistant on the stage,
are natural movements, attracting no attention, yet necessary
to hide the vital signals in the cipher code of the show.</p>

<p>“In the programme and show bills it is emphasized that the
lady and gentleman on the stage have their backs to the audience,
while Svengali, down in the aisle, has his back to the stage,
making collusion apparently impossible. This makes a profound
impression on the public.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h4>“A CONFEDERATE BEHIND A SCREEN.</h4>

<p>“But not a word is said of that curious screen panel, bearing
a dou­ble-head­ed eagle—the Austrian coat of arms—sur­mount­ing
a large cabinet of costumes occupying so much space on the
stage. The pro­gramme does not explain that this screen panel
is trans­parent from behind and that an accomplice with a strong
magnifying lens reads every move made by Svengali and repeats
his signals to the pretty girl at the piano and the im­per­so­na­tor
at the cabinet.</p>

<h4>“THE SYSTEMS EXPLAINED.</h4>

<p>“Here is an illustration of how the figure system can be
worked. As explained above, the famous personages, popular
songs and operas are on numbered lists. Svengali in the aisle,
with his code of signals, has all these numbers committed to
memory.</p>

<p>“When a spectator whispers ‘Dickens’ Svengali knows it is
No. 4, and he signals accordingly.</p>

<p>“But how?</p>

<p>“By touching his head, chin, or breast, or that particular part
of his body designated in the signal code of the Svengali Company.
The diagram given herewith illustrates the system of
com­mu­ni­ca­tion by numbers, nine figures and a cipher (0), by
which all the wealth of the world may be measured, and any
number of words may be communicated without a word of
speech. One has but to map out a square on his face, breast or
body, and number it with these nine figures, with an extra space
for the cipher, to be ready for the Svengali business. That is,
when he has memorized the names and the numbers representing
them. <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span></p>

<p>“Say the human head is used for this purpose. Imagine the
top of the head, right hand side, as No. 1, the right ear as No. 2,
the jaw as No. 3, and the neck as the cipher; the forehead No. 4,
the nose No. 5, the chin No. 6, the top of the head on the left side
as No. 7, the left ear No. 8, and the left side of the jaw No. 9.</p>

<p>“Thus you have the code system by which operators can
communicate volumes by using a codified list of numbered words
or sentences.</p>

<div class="dctr07"><img src="images/i197.png"
width="269" height="388" alt="" /></div>

<p>“If you label the Lord’s Prayer No. 4, and the Declaration
of Independence No. 5, you may instantly telegraph the mighty
literature through wireless space—enough literature to save all
Europe from anarchy—by two natural movements of the hand.</p>

<p>“You can label your eyes, your movements or even your
glances, making them take the places of the nine omnipotent
numbers. Again: Glance upward to the right for No. 1, straight
upward for No. 2, and upward to the left for No. 3. Repeating,
glancing horizontally for Nos. 4, 5 and 6. Repeating the same
again, by glancing downward for Nos. 7, 8 and 9, and stroking
your chin for the cipher (0).</p>

<p>“With your back to the audience, you can telegraph in a similar
way, using your arm and elbow to make the necessary signals.
Let the right arm, hanging down, represent No. 1; the elbow,
projecting from the side, No. 2; elbow raised,
No. 3. Repeat <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
with the left arm for Nos. 4, 5 and 6; with either hand placed
naturally behind you, on the small of the back, above the belt and
over your shoulder for Nos. 7, 8 and 9, and on the back of your
head or neck for the cipher (0).”</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact to note that the Chevalier Pinetti was
the first exhibitor of the second-sight trick. Houdin revived (or
re-invented) it.</p>

<p>On the 12th of December, 1846, he announced in his bill,
“In this programme, M. Robert-Houdin’s son, who is gifted with
marvelous second sight, after his eyes have been covered with a
thick bandage, will designate every object presented to him by the
audience.” In his memoirs he thus describes how he came to
invent the trick:</p>

<p>“My two children were playing one day in the drawing-room
at a game they had invented for their own amusement. The
younger had bandaged his elder brother’s eyes, and made him
guess at the objects he touched, and when the latter happened to
guess right, they changed places. This simple game suggested
to me the most complicated idea that ever crossed my mind.</p>

<p>“Pursued by the notion, I ran and shut myself up in my workroom,
and was fortunately in that happy state
when the mind <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
follows easily the combinations traced by fancy. I rested my
head in my hands, and, in my excitement, laid down the first
principles of second sight.”</p>

<p>Houdin never revealed his method of working the trick.</p>

<p>Robert Heller’s successors in mental magic are Max Berol
and wife, and the Zancigs. Among other feats Berol is able to
memorize over two hundred words called out by the spectators
and written down on a slip of paper by some gentleman. Berol
will then write these words backwards and forwards without
hesitation and name any one of them by its number in the list.
The Zancigs are marvels in the art of second sight. They were
born in Copenhagen, Denmark, but are naturalized citizens of the
United States. Clever advertisers, they lay claim to occult
powers, as the following notice in the Washington Post, April
30, 1905, will testify:</p>

<p>“Although Prof. Zancig and Mme. Zancig, who will be at
Chase’s this week, are naturalized Americans, they come from
Denmark. They first developed their transmission of thought
from one mind to another—or what is known as telepathy—while
journeying through the Orient. They found that quite
a number of the Orientals had found it possible to control
‘thought waves’ and transmit them to the minds of others, just
as Marconi, with his wireless telegraphy, controls electric waves
and transmits them to an objective point. Prof. Zancig discovered
that Mme. Zancig was inceptive, and he could readily transmit
to her mind the thoughts of his own. The tests were continued,
and became so positive and conclusive that it was decided
to give public exhibitions.</p>

<p>“While in India, Prof. and Mme. Zancig saw some astonishing
telepathic exhibitions, which encouraged them to still greater
efforts. They gave exhibitions before the Maharajah, near
Delhi; before the Chinese minister at Hongkong, and before the
Japanese officials of highest grades, who took great interest in
the mental tests. One remarkable incident occurred at Potchefstroom,
South Africa, where the natives are extremely super­sti­tious.
The exhibition had been extensively advertised, and the
house was full. The entertainment created a sensation. As long
as Prof. Zancig remained on the stage everything
was all right, <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
but when he went among the audience and read dates of coins,
inscriptions on letters, and performed other remarkable feats,
the audience suddenly became panic-stricken, and there was a
mad rush for windows, doors, or any other means of exit. In
five minutes the hall was empty, and nothing could induce the
people to return. After concluding his tour abroad, Prof. Zancig
and his wife returned to America, and began an American tour
which has been uninterruptedly successful and will extend to
every section of the United States.”</p>

<p>Two clever performers of the second-sight trick are Harry
and Mildred Rouclere. Mr. Rouclere gives a very pleasing
magical entertainment.</p>

spent such happy years. The rain is gently pattering upon the
shingled roof; the distant woods are waxing green under the
soft influences of the season; the blackbirds are calling in the tree

<p>The intervening years are all blotted out. I am young again,

To a boy fresh from the delights of the Arabian Nights this is

I, too, will become a conjurer, and hold the groundlings spellbound;
bring bowls of goldfish from a shawl; cook puddings in
a borrowed hat; pull rabbits from old gentlemen’s pockets.</p>

<p>Dear old Wyman, ventriloquist as well as pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur,
old-time showman, and the delight of my boyhood—what a
weary pilgrimage you had of it in this world; wandering up and
down, never at rest, traveling thousands of miles by stagecoach,
steamboat, and railroad, giving entertainments
in little villages <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
and towns all over the United States, and welcomed everywhere
by happy children. The big cities you left to your more ambitious
brethren. But what of that? You brought thereby more

<span class="smcap">W<b>YMAN,</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">THE</span>
<span class="smcap">M<b>AGICIAN.</b></span>

<div>(From an Old Print, Ellison Collection.)</div></div></div>

<p>Wyman was born in Albany, N. Y., and was reported to be
sixty-five years of age at the time of his death. Just when he
went on the stage, I have been unable to ascertain. Mr. George
Wood, who is now running a small curio shop on Filbert Street,
Philadelphia, was for sixteen years Wyman’s manager. He
afterwards went with Pharazyn and Frederick Eugene Powell.
Thanks to my friend, Mr. C. S. Eby, who interviewed Mr. Wood
during the summer of 1905, I have obtained a few facts concerning
Wyman’s career. After giving exhibitions all over the
United States in school houses and small halls, Wyman went
abroad and brought back with him quite an outfit of apparatus,
most of it purchased, I presume, from
Voisin’s Repository in <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
Paris. Voisin was the only manufacturer of magical novelties
in those days. About 1850 Wyman played in New York City
under the management of P. T. Barnum. When the magician
Anderson sold out, Wyman bought considerable of his paraphernalia,
such as the “Magic Cauldron” (Phillippe’s old trick),
the “Nest of Boxes,” “Aerial Suspension,” “Inexhaustible Bottle,”
and “Gun Trick.” In 1867 Wyman started the “gift show”
in connection with his magic entertainment, sometimes giving
away building lots as a first prize. He introduced the Sphinx
illusion in the South for the first time and made a tremendous
hit. People would come twenty miles to see it. He had a wonderful
memory, which he applied to a second-sight act. The
articles were placed in a handkerchief by the boy who borrowed
them and the professor managed to get one secret look at the collection.
From his remembrance he would later describe the
articles while they were held aloft still tied in the handkerchief.
Another favorite illusion was the borrowing of a watch, which
was pounded and afterwards found under one of the spectators
(not a confederate). It was one of the duties of Wood to slip
the borrowed watch in place while ostensibly selling magic
books.</p>

<p>Wyman retired from the stage eventually, and lived in Philadelphia
for several years at 612 North Eleventh Street. Afterwards
he moved to Burlington, New Jersey, where he bought
an imposing country place. He owned considerable real estate.
He died July 31, 1881. A few days before his death he called
to see his old friend Thomas W. Yost, the manufacturer of magical
apparatus, of Philadelphia. He must have had a premonition
of his demise, for he remarked to Mr. Yost, as he left the
store: “You will not see me again. This is the last of Wyman.”
In a few days he was dead. He was buried at Fall River, Massachusetts,
the home of his wife. Wyman’s show consisted of
ventriloquism, magic, and an exhibition of Italian <i>fantochini</i>
(puppets). He was one of the best entertainers of his day.</p>

<p>I took to magic at an early age—not the magic of the sleight
of hand artist, however, but the real goetic
or black magic, <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
as black as any old grimoire of mediæval days could make it.
Aye, darker in hue than any inveighed against in the famous
Dæmonologie of King James I. of Protestant memory. I
believed firmly in witches, ghosts, goblins, voodoo spells, and
conjure doctors. But what can you expect of a small boy surrounded
by negro servants, the relics of the old régime of slavery,
who still held tenaciously to the devil-lore of their ancestors
of the African jungle? At nightfall I dared not go near the
smoke-house for fear of the witches who held their revels there.
One day my father brought home a book for his library. It
was Mackey’s <i>Extraordinary Popular Delusions; or, The Madness
of Crowds</i>. That work of absorbing interest opened my
eyes to the unreality of the old super­sti­tions. I read it with
avidity. It became a sort of Bible to me. It lies on the table
before me, as I pen these lines; a much-thumbed, faded, old book.</p>

<p>The first amateur sleight of hand show I ever took part in,
was given by a boy named Albert Niblack. The <i>matinée magique</i>
was held in a stable attached to my father’s house. The entrance
fee was three pins, orchestra chairs ten pins. The stage was
erected in the carriage house, and the curtain consisted of a
couple of sheets sur­rep­ti­tious­ly borrowed from the household
linen closet. I acted as the conjurer’s assistant. The success
of the entertainment was phenomenal. The audience consisted
of some thirty children, with a sprinkling of negro nurses who
came to preserve order among the smaller fry, and an old horse
who persisted in sticking his head through a window near the
stage, his stall being in an adjoining compartment. He occupied
the only private box in the theatre. Among other tricks on the
programme, young Niblack produced a small canary bird from
an egg which had been previously examined and declared to
be the real product of the hen by all the colored experts present,
who tested it on their teeth. One fat old mammy, with her
head picturesquely done up in a red bandana handkerchief, was
so overcome by the trick that she shouted out: “Fo de Lawd
sake! Dat boy mus’ be kin to de Debbil sho,’&#x202f;” and regretted the
fact that she did not have a rabbit’s foot with her, to ward off
the spells. Years have passed since then. Young Niblack is now
Lieut. Commander Niblack, U. S. N.,
erstwhile naval attaché <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
of the American embassy at Berlin, etc. I wonder if he still
practises magic. He obtained his insight into the mysteries of
conjuring from a little book of sleights, puzzles and chemical
experiments, a cheap affair and very crude. Like Houdin, he
had to create the principles of legerdemain himself, for the book
contained no real information on the subject. It was manufactured
to <i>sell</i> in two senses of the word, and to the best of my
belief, was purchased at the circus. Among that audience were
several children who have since become famous, to a greater or
less extent. There was Umei Tsuda, a diminutive Japanese girl,
sent to this country to be educated, and who now presides over
a great normal school in Japan; Waldemar Bodisco (son of
Count Bodisco, the Russian Minister to the United States), now
an officer in the Czar’s navy; and, if I mistake not, Agustin
de Iturbide, the adopted son of the ill-fated Maximilian, who
attempted to found an empire in Mexico, bolstered up by French
bayonets. Young Iturbide’s mother, after the tragic death of
Maximilian, came to Georgetown to reside and educate her son,
the heir to the throne of Mexico. Poor fellow, he was a prince,
but he did not plume himself because of the fact, for he was in
reality a “boy without a country.” We were classmates in the
preparatory department of Georgetown College. His career is
one of the romances of history. He is now living an exile in an
old country house in the District of Columbia, where he spends
his time reading and dreaming.</p>

<p>I entered upon the practise of sleight of hand in the year
1877, after reading Hoffmann’s <i>Modern Magic</i>. I adopted Houdin’s
method of carrying a pack of cards and other articles in
my pockets. On my way to school, over a long country road,
I put in some hard practise, learning to <i>sauter le coupe</i>, and
palm most any small object. While in class one day, I was
caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, with a pack of cards in my hand, by
the dignified old Latin professor. I was sent to the Principal
of the Academy for punishment, which I received like a stoic,
but vowing vengeance on the Latin pedagogue, who
was a very <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span>
orthodox religionist, the principal of a Baptist Sunday school,
and consequently held cards in abhorrence. I often heard him
remark that cards were the “Devil’s Looking Glasses.” One
day, I slipped a couple of packs of cards in the sleeve of the
professor’s overcoat, which hung upon the wall back of his desk,
and tipped the wink to the boys. They were astounded at my
audacity. When the class was dismissed, the scholars lingered
around to see the fun. The professor went to put on his coat,
whereupon the cards flew about the room in a shower, being
propelled by the impact of his arm, which he thrust violently
into the sleeve. The boys, with a great shout, began picking up
the scattered pasteboards, which they presented to the teacher,
commiserating with him in his trouble. The old man, who was
very angry, disclaimed ownership of the detested cards, and got
out of the room as speedily as possible. Perhaps it is needless
to remark that I failed miserably in the Latin examinations that
year. But it may have been owing to my stupidity and not to
any animus on the professor’s part. Let us hope so.</p>

<p>After long practise in legerdemain, I determined to give an
entertainment, and selected as my assistant, my school chum,
Edward L. Dent, a boy who possessed great mechanical genius.
Later in life he graduated with honors as
a mechanical engineer <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span>
from Stevens’ Institute, New Jersey, and founded a great iron
mill in Georgetown. Poor fellow, he met with business reverses
and lost a fortune. He died some five or six years ago. Young
Dent lived in a historical mansion on the heights of Georgetown,
surrounded by a great park of oaks. It was the home of John
C. Calhoun, when he was Secretary of State of the United States.
In the great attic of the house, Judge Dent had fitted up a superb
carpenter shop and forge for his son.</p>

<p>Here my chum and I manufactured our apparatus: the
Washerwoman’s Bottle, the Nest of Boxes <i>à la</i> Kellar; the Card
Star; the Coffee and Milk Vases; the Sphinx Table, etc. When
all was ready, about two hundred invitations were sent out for
a <i>Soirée Magique</i>. The great drawing-room of the house was
fitted up as a theatre, with a stage at one end and drop curtain.
We fenced in the stage with rich draperies, after the style of
Robert Heller, and our gilded tables and silver candelabra with
wax tapers looked very fine against the crimson background.
It was the most elaborate amateur show I ever saw. Twenty
minutes before the curtain rang up, both magician and assistant
were seized with stage fright. We had peeped through a hole in
the curtain and taken in the sea of faces. We dared not confront
that crowd of youngsters without a mask of some kind.
Happy thought! We decided to blacken our faces with burnt
cork and appear as negro necromancers. The performance went
off very well indeed, until we came to the “Card Star.” O fatal
Pentagram of Pythagoras! The cards were chosen from a
pack and rammed down the mouth of a big pistol, preparatory
to firing them at the star, on the points of which they were to
appear. I began my patter, facing the audience. “Ladies and
gentlemen, I will give you an exhibition of magic marksmanship.
I will fire this pistol (laughter) at the star on yonder table (renewed
laughter), and the cards”—(ironical cat calls). I turned
around, and to my horror, the duplicate cards were already
sticking to the star; my assistant had let off the apparatus too
soon. The curtain fell. I shed tears of rage at the fiasco. But,
later on, I learned to act more philosophically. Magicians are
subject to these mistakes. I have
seen Alexander Herrmann’s <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
calculations all upset by comical contretemps of like character
to the above, but he smiled benignantly and went right along as
unconcernedly as ever. Conjuring certainly gets on the nerves
of its devotees.</p>

<p>Amateur magicians are called upon to exhibit their skill in all
sorts of places. I once gave a performance in a Pullman car,
going at full speed. It was on the occasion of a pilgrimage to
the Scottish Rite temples of the Southwest, with a party of
eminent members of the fraternity. This was in the spring of
1904. Among those who went on the journey were the Hon.
James Daniel Richardson, 33°, Sovereign Grand Commander of
the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the
Southern jurisdiction of the United States, and Admiral Winfield
Scott Schley, 32°, the “hero of Santiago,” a most genial
traveling companion and raconteur. Mr. Richardson had jocularly
appointed me Hierophant of the Mysteries, so I took along
with me a box full of magic apparatus, to amuse the Initiates
when time hung heavy on their hands. My first performance
was given while speeding across the State of Kentucky. At one
end of an observation car I arranged my table and paraphernalia.
In honor of the Admiral, I got up an impromptu trick, which I
called, “After the Battle of Santiago.” Borrowing a silk hat,
and showing it empty, I began as follows:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, stretch your imag­i­na­tions, like Jules Verne, and
let this hat represent the cruiser Brooklyn, Admiral Schley’s ship.
This oscillating Pullman car is the ocean. The great battle
of Santiago is over. Victory has crowned the American arms.
An order comes from the flagship to decorate the vessels of the
fleet with bunting. The sailors of the Brooklyn dive down into
the hold and bring up a variety of flags. (Here I produced from
the hat the flags of all nations.) They are not satisfactory. Roll
them together, says the commander, and see what the composition
will make. (I rolled the flags into a bundle, which I proceeded
to throw in the air, whereupon a big silk American flag
appeared, the smaller ensigns having disappeared.)
Ah, the Star <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
Spangled Banner, under whose folds the men of many nations
live in amity as fellow citizens.”</p>

<p>I waved the flag in the air, amid the plaudits of the spectators.
Just then the car gave a terrific lurch, while rounding a
curve; I lost my balance and was precipitated head first like a
battering ram against the capacious stomach of an old gentleman,
seated in the front row. He doubled up with pain.</p>

<p>“Say, what kind of a trick do you call that?” he gasped out.</p>

<p>“That,” said I, “is a representation of a sailor on board of
the Brooklyn falling overboard.”</p>

<p>“I call it a monkey trick,” he groaned. His dignity and digestive
apparatus had been sadly upset. From that time on, he
eyed me with suspicion whenever I gave a show, and always took
a chair in the back row of seats.</p>

<p>“Speaking of monkey tricks,” said Admiral Schley, “reminds
me of an incident that occurred when I was a midshipman on
board of the steam frigate Niagara, in 1860. A monkey was the
pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur. We were conveying back to their native land
the Japanese embassy that had visited the United States in return
for the visit made to their country by Commodore Perry some
years before. One of the embassy bought a monkey at Anger
Point, Africa, during a stoppage at that place. He (the monkey,
not the Ambassador) proved to be a most mischievous brute,
and was continually picking and stealing eatables from the cook’s
galley. Worse than that, so far as the sailors were concerned,
the ‘missing link’ of Darwin took a special delight in upsetting
pots and pans of grease on the deck, which the seamen had to
clean up. When chased by some irate Jack Tar with a rope’s
end, the monkey would take refuge in the rigging, where he
would hang by his tail from a spar, and grin with delight at his
enemies. We all hated the beast, but respect for our Japanese
guests forbade revenge. Finally an old sailor caught the monkey
and greased his tail. Soon after, the simian committed one of
his daily depredations and hied himself, as usual, up the rigging,
where he attempted to swing from a yardarm by his greased tail.
But, alas, he fell overboard and was drowned. The verdict rendered
was that he had committed suicide. His only mourners
were the Mikado’s ambassadors.” <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span></p>

<p>The study of natural magic is wonderfully fascinating. It
possesses, too, a decided pedagogic value, which eminent scholars
have not been slow to recognize. Those who obtain an insight
into its principles are preserved against infection from the many
psychical epidemics of the age. The subject is of interest to
scientists. Dr. G. Stanley Hall, at one time professor of experimental
psychology at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
Md., at present president of Clarke University, Worcester, Massachusetts,
used to exhibit conjuring tricks to his classes, to illustrate
the illusions of the senses. An eminent German scientist,
Dr. Max Dessoir, has written learnedly on the psychology of
legerdemain. Prof. Joseph Jastrow, of the University of Wisconsin,
subjected the conjurers, Herrmann and Kellar, to a
series of careful tests, to ascertain their “tactile sensibility, sensitiveness
to textures, accuracy of visual perception, quickness of
movement, mental processes,” etc. The results of these tests were
printed in <i>Science</i>, Vol. III, page 685–689, under the title of
“Psychological Notes upon Sleight-of-hand Experts.”</p>

<p>The literature of natural magic is not extensive. Thirty
years ago, first-class works in English on legerdemain
were rare. Houdin’s <i>Secrets de la Prestidigitation et
de la Magie</i>, which was published in 1868, was out of
print, and, says Prof. Hoffmann, “the possession of a
copy was regarded among professors of magic as a boon of
the highest possible value.” Hoffmann picked up an old
second-hand copy of the work in Paris, and translated it in
the year 1877. To-day, books on sleight of hand have been
multiplying rapidly. Every professor of the art thinks it
incumbent upon him to publish a treatise on magic. Strange
to say, the good works on the subject have been written by
amateurs. Prof. Hoffmann (Angelo Lewis), a member of the
London bar, has written the best book, following him have
come Edwin Sachs and C. Lang Neill. The autobiography of
that arch-master of magic, Robert-Houdin, was translated,
in 1859, by Dr. R. Shelton Mackenzie, of Philadelphia.
Thomas Frost, in 1881, produced an interesting work on the
<i>Lives of the Conjurers</i>, but it is now quite out of date.
I know of no really scholarly treatise extant to-day on
the history of pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion. <span class="xxpn"

<p>I have been very fortunate in my researches in the history
of magic, to have had access to several private collections of
books, old playbills, programmes, prints, etc., relating to the subject.
I myself have been an indefatigable collector of books and
pamphlets treating of magic and magicians. But my library
pales into insignificance beside that of my friend, Dr. Saram R.
Ellison, of New York City. Dr. Ellison is a practising physician
and, like many others of his profession, a great lover of escamotage,
perhaps because of its relationship to
psychology. He has <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
in his collection of books, many rare volumes picked up in Europe
and elsewhere. At the present writing his library contains nearly
one thousand two hundred titles, among them being rare copies
of Decremps (1789–1793), Pinetti (1785), Breslaw (1812),
Porta (1658), Kosmann (1817), Witgeest (1773), Naudeus
(1657), etc., etc. In the year 1902, Kellar visited the Ellison
library. He endeavored to purchase the collection for $2,000.
Dr. Ellison refused to part with his beloved books. In his will
he has left the collection to Columbia University, New York
City. One of the doctor’s fads is the collection of wands of
famous magicians. He possesses over sixty rods of the modern
magi, and has often contemplated sending an expedition to
Egypt to discover the wands used by Moses and Aaron. Among
his collection are wands formerly wielded by Carl, Leon, Alexander
and Mme. Herrmann (four representatives of one family),
Willmann, Anderson, Blitz, de Kolta, Hoffmann, Goldin, Maskelyne,
Powell, McAllister, Robinson, Kellar, Fox, etc. Each
of the wands is accompanied by a story, which will be published
in the near future.</p>

<p>When the citizen-king, Louis Philippe, ruled over the destinies
of <i>la belle</i> France, there resided in Paris an old man, by the
name of M. Roujol, familiarly known among his confrères as
“Father” Roujol. He kept a modest shop in the Rue Richelieu
for the manufacture and sale of magical apparatus. The professional
and amateur conjurers of the French capital made Roujol’s
their meeting place. “The Duc de
<span class="nowrap">M<img class="iglyph-a"
 src="images/dash-2em.png" width="141"
 height="60" alt="——" />,”</span> says Robert-Houdin,
“did not disdain to visit the humble emporium of the
mystic art, and remain for hours conversing with Roujol and his
associates.” It was here that Houdin became acquainted with
Jules de Rovère, of noble birth, a conjurer who abandoned the
title of <i>escamoteur</i>, as beneath his aristocratic dignity, and coined
for himself the pompous cognomen, <i>pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur</i>, from <i>presti
digiti</i> (activity of the fingers). The French Academy sanctioned
the formation of this word, thus handing it down to posterity.
Jules de Rovère also called himself <i>Physicien du Roi</i>.
Old Father Roujol is dust long ago. We have
replicas of his <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
quaint place in New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia.
On Sixth Avenue, not far from Thirtieth Street, New York City,
is the shop of the Martinka Brothers. It is located on the ground
floor of a dingy old building. In front is a tiny window, with
a variety of magical apparatus displayed therein. Above the
door, in tarnished gold letters, is the sign, “Palace of Magic.”
The second floor is occupied by a Chinese restaurant. The Occident
and Orient exist here cheek-by-jowl. The Chinaman concocts
mysterious dishes to tickle the jaded palates of the <i>boulevardiers</i>;
the proprietors of the Aladdin Palace of Up-to-Date
Enchantments invent ingenious tricks and illusions to astound
the eyes of their patrons. Here I met Robinson, de Kolta, Kellar,
and many other conjurers of note. The Society of American
Magicians holds its meetings at Martinka’s.</p>

<p>This society owes its foundation to two practising physicians
of New York, Dr. W. Golden Mortimer, an ex-conjurer, and
Dr. Saram R. Ellison, the collector of magic literature. Ellison
suggested the name, Mortimer wrote the ritual of
the order, and <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
the two of them called the meeting for the formation of the
society. The first idea of such a fraternity of magicians was
formulated by the writer of this book, who endeavored to found
a society called the “Sphinx,” but it proved abortive. The leading
conjurers of the United States and Europe are enrolled
among the members of the S. A. M. The meetings are held
once a month, at Martinka’s, usually followed by exhibitions of
skill on the stage of the Bijou Theatre, attached to the place.
Robert-Houdin, in the closing chapter of his <i>Secrets of Conjuring
and Magic</i>, remarks that it would be a superb sight to
witness a performance by magicians, where each would show his
<i>chef d’oeuvre</i> in the art. At Martinka’s this is realized. Here
you may see the very perfection of digital dexterity, mental
magic, and the like. Mr. Francis J. Martinka possesses many
interesting relics of celebrated performers: Alexander Herrmann’s
wand, Robert Heller’s orange tree, and photographs
galore of magicians, living and dead. Some of the most important
illusions of the day have been built in the shop of the Martinka
Brothers. Other manufacturers in New York City are
Witmark &amp; Sons, and Mr. Beadle, a veteran mechanic and erstwhile
assistant to Robert Heller.</p>

<p>In Boston we have the magic emporiums of W. D. LeRoy
and C. Milton Chase; and in Chicago, that of A. Roterberg.
Both LeRoy and Roterberg are fine sleight-of-hand performers.
Mr. Roterberg is the author of a clever work on card conjuring,
which ranks very high in the estimation of the profession, also
several little brochures on up-to-date legerdemain. In Philadelphia,
Mr. Thomas Yost, a veteran manufacturer of magical
apparatus, holds forth. He has built many fine illusions and
tricks. In London, we have the well-known firm of Hamley &amp;
Co.; in Paris, Caroly and De Vere. There is no dearth of periodicals
devoted to the art of magic. Among the leading ones are:
<i>Mahatma</i>, Brooklyn, New York; <i>The Sphinx</i>, Kansas City, Missouri;
<i>Magic</i> and <i>The Wizard</i>, London; <i>The Magician</i>, Liverpool;
<i>L’Illusioniste</i>, Paris; and
<i>Der Zauberspiegel</i>, Berlin.</p>

<p class="pfirst">They
come back to me, those old days in the newspaper office
in Baltimore. I can shut my eyes and see the long, dingy room
with its ink-splattered tables and flaring gas jets. The printers’
devils rushing in and out with wet proof-sheets. Reporters come
and go. Look! There is Joe Kelly, Lefevre, Jarrett and John
Monroe. And here comes Ludlam, familiarly known as “Lud,”
the prince of Bohemian newsgatherers; a cross between Dickens’
Alfred Jingle and Murger’s Rodolph. He is always “down on
his luck,” but nothing can phase his natural gaiety and bonhomie.
He snaps his fingers at Fate, and mocks at the world.
On his death bed he made bon mots. Poor old Ludlam, he is
forever associated with my introduction to Alexander the Great.</p>

<p>I look back across the years that separate me from my journalistic
experiences, and see myself seated at a reporter’s table,
on a certain morning in January, waiting for an assignment from
the city editor; a fire, a murder, political interview, I knew not
what, and therein lies the ineffable charm of newspaper reporting.
Enter Ludlam, jaunty and debonaire. The snow encrusts his
faded coat with powdery flakes. He strikes a theatrical attitude,
and exclaims: “Philosophers say that the Devil is dead! Gentlemen,
don’t you believe them. I have just had an interview
with His Satanic Majesty, and he is very much alive. He was
beautifully perfumed with sulphur (or was it cigarette smoke?);
and wore a fur-lined overcoat. Coming from
a tropical climate, <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span>
he finds this cold weather very disagreeable. He turned my
watch into a turnip and back again. He took a roll of greenbacks
from my coat pocket. That was sure enough witchcraft.
I defy any other person than Beelzebub to get money from <i>my</i>
clothes. He extracted a hard-boiled egg from my nose, and a
rabbit from my hat. But seeing is believing. Here he is now!”</p>

<p>With that he threw open the green baize door with a crash,
and in walked Alexander Herrmann, the magician, smiling and
bowing. This little comedy had been arranged by the irrepressible
Ludlam. He was a great practical joker. We shouted
with laughter. This was my first introduction to Alexander
the Great, who was making his periodical visit to the newspaper
offices, and he came to the <i>News</i> first, because it was an afternoon
journal. He was to play that night at Ford’s Opera House. He
performed a number of capital tricks for us with watches, coins,
handkerchiefs and rings, and was pronounced a royal good fellow
by the entire outfit—editors, reporters, typesetters and devils.
Being the only amateur magician on the paper, I was detailed
to accompany the famous conjurer on his
“swing around the <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span>
magic circle.” I was delighted with my assignment. We traversed
the markets; visited the Stock Exchange, where a howling
mob of brokers danced a carmagnole about us; and the police
stations. Herrmann was received everywhere with acclamations.
His impromptu feats of magic evoked shouts of laughter.
On one of the street cars the following scene took place, which
I hugely enjoyed:</p>

<p>The conductor, a cadaverous, solemn looking man, who took
the world and himself seriously, came around to collect the fares.
He accosted the conjurer first.</p>

<p>“Fare.” exclaimed Herrmann, with an expressive shrug of
the shoulders. “Why, I paid mine long ago.”</p>

<p>“No such thing!” snapped the conductor.</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow—!”</p>

<p>“You can’t come that game on me!” said the conductor. “I
demand your fare, at once, or off you go.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, man, I gave you a five-dollar gold piece, but
you did not return the change. You said, ‘Wait until’—. But
here is the gold coin sticking in your scarf.” So saying,
the conjurer proceeded to extract a coin from the muffler
which the conductor wore about his neck. “And worse than
that, you’ve robbed me.” Then seizing hold of the coat of
the dumbfounded man, he took from his breast pocket a large
bundle of what seemed to be greenbacks. These, Herrmann
scattered about the car. On each note was printed his
portrait and an advertisement of his show. At a trifling
distance these advertisements resembled greenbacks.
They were more or less facsimiles of U. S. Treasury
certificates. The occupants of the car picked them up, and
laughed heartily at the mystification. Herrmann then paid
his fare, presented the conductor and driver with passes to
the theater, and in a little while we got off at Barnum’s
hotel, where we had luncheon. The negro waiters of the
establishment eyed him with fear and trembling, for he had
played many practical jokes on them, and they never knew
when he would break out in a new spot. He had a capital
trick of raising a glass of wine to his lips as if about
to partake of it, when with a dash of the hand upwards the
glass would vanish, wine and all, only to be reproduced a
minute later from somebody’s coat tail. <span class="xxpn"

<p>“In March, 1885, while in Madrid, I appeared at the Sasuella
Theatre quite successfully, for the house was filled every evening
with hidalgos and noble senoras, and King Alphonso XII. was
kind enough to view my performance from a box. He was so
pleased that I was asked to the palace, and knowing him to be a
great sportsman, I presented him with a silver-mounted saddle
which I had brought with me from Buenos Ayres. He was
exceedingly kind, and after I had performed a mathematical trick
with cards, which pleased him greatly, he kept asking me continually
if he could not be of some service to me. At first I did not
accept, but a little while afterwards I thought it would
be a great <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
thing if I could make the King of Spain my confederate in a trick.
He consented, laughingly, and it was so arranged that from the
stage I was to ask one of the audience to write a number, when
the King was to get up and say, ‘I will write it,’ and do it. Of
course, with such a confederate, the trick was accomplished with
the greatest effect. The first thing I did in beginning the second
part of my performance was to take a blank piece of paper. This
I handed to the King, asking him to sign it at the bottom. He
did so readily, and the paper was passed from hand to hand and
given to me. I conjured up all the spirits that have been or will
be, and lo and behold! the paper was closely written from the
top to the place where His Majesty’s signature was affixed. It
was handed back to him, and, while he laughed very heartily,
he said, ‘I will not deny my signature to this document, which
appoints Alexander Herrmann pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur to the King of
Spain, and, as the spirits have done so, I heartily acquiesce.’&#x202f;”</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the peculiar properties of
sympathetic inks will readily understand the modus operandi
of the above trick. For example: Copper sulphate in very dilute
solution will produce an invisible handwriting, which will turn
light blue when subjected to the vapor of ammonia. Again,
write with a weak solution of sulphuric acid and the chirography
will appear in black letters when the paper is submitted to a
strong heat. To obtain the requisite heat, all you have to do
is to lay the sheet of paper on a small table which has a top of
thin sheet iron or tin. Beneath this top, concealed in the body of
the table, is a spirit lamp—not a lamp run by spooks, but “spirits
of wine.” Ample time for the chemical operation to take place
is afforded by the patter of the conjurer.</p>

<p>Another clever trick, bordering on the supernatural, was
Herrmann’s “Thibetan Mail,” the effect of which was as follows:
Handing a sheet of note paper to various persons in the audience,
Herrmann requested them to write sentences upon it, one
under the other. When this was accomplished, he tore the paper
into halves, and requested some gentleman to retain one half.
The other half the magician thrust into the flame of a candle
and burned it to ashes. Flinging the ashes in the air, he cried:
“I send this message to the mighty Mahatma who
dwells in the <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
great temple of Lhassa. Let him restore the paper intact and
return it to me by spiritual post.” No sooner said than done.
Immediately a District Messenger boy rushed into the theatre,
down the center aisle, waving in his hand a sealed letter. Handing
this to some one in the audience, Herrmann requested him to
break the seal and examine the contents of the envelope. Inside
of the envelope he found a second one, and within that a third
and fourth, etc. In the last envelope the half sheet of paper was
revealed perfectly restored. Its identity was proved by matching
it with the half-sheet of writing retained by the first spectator,
whereupon they were found to fit exactly, and the writing to
correspond. The modus operandi of this astounding feat, like
all good things in magic, is very simple, but it requires adroitness
on the part of the performer to execute properly. The conjurer
does not burn the piece of paper which contains the writing,
but exchanges it for a dummy which he thrusts into the
flame of the candle. The original half-sheet of paper is secretly
transferred to an assistant, usually in the following manner: The
magician calls for a candle and matches, which the assistant
brings in upon a salver. The slip of paper is “worked off” to
the assistant in the act of taking the candle and matches from the
tray. The confederate then goes behind the scenes, slips the
paper into a “nest of envelopes,” seals them simultaneously,
and gives the package to a stage hand habited as a messenger
boy, who runs to the front part of the house to await the cue
from the conjurer. This trick was intended as a burlesque on
Madame Blavatsky’s Indian Mail feat.</p>

<p>I remember very well performing this experiment at an
amateur show at the home of Mr. O― H―, of Baltimore, some
eighteen years ago, before a company of interested spectators,
among whom was the charming daughter of the house, Miss
Alice, now the Countess Andrezzi Bernini, of Rome, Italy. My
stage was situated in an alcove at one end of the splendid drawing
room, and it had a window opening on a side street. My
District Messenger boy, hired for the occasion, and privately
instructed how to act, was stationed beneath this window, and
threatened with all the penalties of Dante’s Inferno if he went
asleep at his post. My brother,
Walter Dorsey Evans, <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
afterwards a skillful amateur pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur, acted as my assistant,
and adroitly threw the sealed note out of the window to the boy.
Great was the surprise of my audience when the door bell rang
and the stately butler of the establishment brought into the parlor
the messenger boy with his sealed letter.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?” asked the host, as he doubtfully
fingered the envelope and examined the address, which read, “To
Sahib O― H―, Baltimore, Md.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, an old man dressed in a yellow robe came into
the office, and asked that the letter be delivered at once.”</p>

<p>“A Mahatma, I presume!” said the lawyer, ironically.</p>

<p>“He had no hat on, sir, only a turbot wrapped round his
head.”</p>

<p>“A turban, I suppose you mean.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, sir—a turbing like the Turks wear.”</p>

<p>“That will do, young man. You may go.”</p>

<p>The boy left. May he be forgiven the lies uttered in my
behalf. But all is fair in love, war, and conjuring. He was
well tutored what to say in the event of his being questioned,
but he performed his part so naturally and lied so artistically and
with such a front of brass as to have deceived the most incredulous.
I have often speculated upon the subsequent career of that
lad. Possibly today he is representing his country abroad in an
important diplomatic post, or manufacturing sensational news
for the yellow press. Had I been a professional conjurer, I
would have hired him on the spot as an assistant.</p>

<p>Alexander Herrmann was born in Paris, February 11, 1844.
Information concerning his family is somewhat meagre. His
father, Samuel Herrmann, was a German Jew, a physician, who
had come to France to reside, and there married a Breton lady.
Sixteen children were born of this union, of whom Carl was the
oldest of the eight boys and Alexander the youngest. Samuel
Herrmann was an accomplished conjurer, but rarely performed
in public. He gave private séances before Napoleon I, who
presented him with a superb watch. This timepiece descended
to Alexander, and is in possession
of his widow. <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span></p>

<p>Carl Herrmann was born in Hanover, Germany, January 23,
1816. Despite parental opposition he became a sleight-of-hand
artist, and was known as the “First Professor of Magic in the
World.” In 1848 he made his first bow to the English people,
at the Adelphi Theatre, London, where he produced the second-sight
trick, which he copied from Houdin in France. Early in
the sixties he made a tour of America, with great success. At his
farewell performance in New York City, he introduced his
brother Alexander as his legitimate successor. Carl then retired
with a fortune to Vienna, where he spent the remainder of his
days in collecting rare antiquities. His death occurred at Carlsbad,
June, 1887, at the age of seventy-two. He was a great
favorite with Czar Nicholas and the Sultan of Turkey and frequently
performed at their palaces.</p>

<p>When quite a boy, he ran away and joined Carl, acting as
his assistant. He remained with his brother six years, when his
parents placed him in college at Vienna. He did not complete
his scholastic studies, but went to Spain in 1859 and began his
career as a magician. He appeared in America in 1861, but
returned a year later to Europe, and made an extended tour.
He played an engagement of 1,000 consecutive nights at Egyptian
Hall, London. In 1875 he married Adelaide Scarsez, a
beautiful and clever danseuse, who assisted him in his <i>soirées
magiques</i>. Herrmann became a naturalized citizen of the United
States in 1876. He died of heart failure in his private car,
December 11, 1896, while traveling from Rochester, N. Y., to
Bradford, Penn., and was buried with Masonic honors in Woodlawn
cemetery, just outside of New York City. He made and
lost several fortunes. Unsuccessful theatrical speculations were
largely responsible for his losses. He aspired in vain to be the
manager and proprietor of a chain of theatres. He introduced
the celebrated Trewey, the French fantaisiste, to the American
public. Herrmann was an extraordinary linguist, a raconteur
and wit. Several chivalric orders were conferred upon him by
European potentates. He usually billed himself as the Chevalier
Alexander Herrmann. His mephistophelean aspect, his foreign
accent, and histrionic powers, coupled with his wonderful
sleight of hand, made him indeed the king of conjurers. He had
a wrist of steel and a palm of velvet. He performed tricks
wherever he went, in the street cars, cafés, clubs, hotels, newspaper
offices, and markets, imitating in this respect the renowned
Bosco. These impromptu entertainments widely advertised his
art. He rarely changed his repertoire, but old tricks in his hands
were invested with the charm of newness. I can remember as
a boy with what emotion I beheld the rising of the curtain, in
his fantastic soirées, and saw him appear, in full court costume,
smiling and bowing. Hey, presto! I expected every moment to
see him metamorphosed into the Mephisto of Goethe’s “Faust,”
habited in the traditional red costume, with red cock’s feather
in his pointed cap, and clanking rapier by
his side; sardonic, <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span>
and full of subtleties. He looked the part to perfection. He was
Mephisto in evening dress. When he performed the trick of the
inexhaustible bottle, which gave forth any liquor called for by
the spectators, I thought of him as Mephisto in that famous
drinking scene in Auerbach’s cellar, boring holes in an old
table, and extracting from them various sparkling liquors as well
as flames. In his nervous hands articles vanished and reappeared
with surprising rapidity. Everything material, under the spell
of his flexible fingers, seemed to be resolved into a fluidic state,
as elusive as pellets of quicksilver. He was indeed the Alexander
the Great of Magic, who had conquered all worlds with his
necromancer’s wand—theatrical worlds; and he sighed because
there were no more to dominate with his legerdemain. One of
his posters always fascinated my boyish
imag­i­na­tion. It was <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
night in the desert. The Sphinx loomed up majestically under
the black canopy of the Egyptian sky. In front of the giant
figure stood Herrmann, in the center of a magic circle of skulls
and cabalistic figures. Incense from a brazier ascended and circled
about the head of the Sphinx. Herrmann was depicted in
the act of producing rabbits and bowls of gold fish from a shawl,
while Mephisto, the guardian of the weird scene, stood near by,
dressed all in red, and pointing approvingly at his disciple in the
black art. In this picture were symbolized Egyptian mystery
and necromancy, mediæval magic, and the sorcery of science and
pre­sti­di­gi­ta­tion.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>When Herrmann came to Baltimore, he always put up at
Barnum’s Hotel, a quaint, old caravansary that had sheltered
beneath its hospitable roof such notables as Charles Dickens,
Thackeray and Jenny Lind. Alas, the historic hostelry was torn
down years ago to make room for improvements. It stood on
the southwest corner of Calvert and Fayette streets, within a
stone’s throw of the Battle Monument. I spent some happy
hours with Herrmann in this ancient hotel, listening to his rich
store of anecdotes. I received from him many valuable hints
in conjuring. There was something exotic about his tastes. He
loved to surround himself with Oriental luxuries, rare curios
picked up in the bazaars of Constantinople, Cairo, and Damascus;
nargilehs, swords of exquisite workmanship; carved ivory
boxes; richly embroidered hangings, and the like. His private
yacht, “Fra Diavolo,” and his Pullman car were fitted up regardless
of expense. Habited in a Turkish dressing gown which
glowed with all the colors of the rainbow; his feet thrust into
red Morocco slippers; the inevitable cigarette in his mouth,
Herrmann resembled a pasha of the East. He was inordinately
fond of pets and carried with him on his travels a Mexican dog,
a Persian cat, cages full of canaries, a parrot and a monkey. His
rooms looked like a small zoo. He seemed to enjoy the noises
made by his pets. His opinions concerning his
art were interesting. <span class="xxpn" id="p227">{227}</span></p>

<p>“A magician is born, not made!” was his favorite apothegm.
“He must possess not only digital dexterity, but be an actor as
well.”</p>

<p>“What is the greatest illusion in the repertoire of the conjurer?”
I asked him.</p>

<p>“The Vanishing Lady of M. Buatier de Kolta,” was the
unhesitating reply.</p>

<p>“Why so?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Because of its simplicity. The great things of magic are
always the simple things. The ‘Vanishing Lady’ trick has the
most transcendant effect when properly produced, but, alas, the
secret is now too well known. Its great success proved its ruin.
Irresponsible bunglers took it up and made a fiasco of it. In the
hands of De Kolta it was perfection itself. There was nothing
wanting in artistic finish.”</p>

<p>Herrmann related to me some amusing episodes of his varied
career. In the year 1863 he was playing an engagement in
Constantinople. He received a summons to appear before the
Sultan and his court. At the appointed hour there came to the
hotel where he was staying a Turkish officer, who drove him in
a handsome equipage to a palace overlooking the gleaming
waters of the Golden Horn, where “ships that fly the flags of half
the world” ride at anchor. It was a lovely afternoon in April.
Herrmann was ushered into a luxuriously furnished apartment
and invited to be seated on a divan. The officer then withdrew.
Presently a couple of tall Arabs entered. One carried a lighted
chibouk; the other a salver, upon which was a golden pot full of
steaming hot Mocha coffee, and a tiny cup and saucer of exquisite
porcelain. The slaves knelt at his feet and presented the tray
and pipe to him.</p>

<p>“A faint suspicion,” said Herrmann, “crossed my mind that
perhaps the tobacco and coffee were drugged with a pinch or two
of hasheesh—that opiate of the East, celebrated by Monte Cristo;
the drug that brings forgetfulness and elevates its votaries to
the seventh heaven of spiritual ecstasy. I thought, ‘what if the
Sultan were trying some of his sleight-of-hand tricks on me for
the amusement of the thing. Sultans have been known to do
such things.’ Now I wanted to keep cool and have all
of my wits <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
about me. My reputation as a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur was at stake.
It was very silly, I suppose, to entertain such ideas. But once
possessed of this absurd obsession I could not get rid of it. So
I waved off the attendants politely and signified by gestures that
I did not desire to indulge in coffee or tobacco. But they persisted,
and I saw that I could not rid myself of them without an
effort. Happy thought! I just took a whiff of the pipe and a sip
of the coffee, when, hey, presto!—I made the chibouk and cup
vanish by my sleight of hand and caused a couple of small snakes,
which I carried upon my person for use in impromptu tricks, to
appear in my hands. The astonishment on the faces of those two
Arabs was something indescribable. They gazed up at the gilded
ceiling and down at the carpet, puzzled to find out where the
articles had gone, but finding no solution to the problem and
beholding the writhing serpents in my hands, fled incontinently
from the room. These simple sons of the desert evidently thought
that I had just stepped out of the Arabian Nights Entertainments.
At this juncture a chamberlain entered and in French
bade me welcome, informing me that His Imperial Majesty was
ready to receive me. He conducted me to a superb salon with
a platform at one end. I looked around me, but saw only one
person, a black-bearded gentleman, who sat in an armchair in
the middle of the apartment. I recognized in him the famous
‘Sick Man of Europe.’ I bowed low to the Sultan Abdul Aziz.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Well, monsieur, begin,’ he said in French.</p>

<p>“And so this was my audience. No array of brilliantly
garbed courtiers and attendants; no music. Only a fat gentleman,
languidly polite, waiting to be amused. How was it possible
to perform with any <i>élan</i> under such depressing conditions?
It takes a large and enthusiastic audience to inspire a performer.
I began my tricks. As I progressed with my programme, however,
I became aware of the presence of other persons in the
room besides the ruler of the Ottoman Empire. The laughter
of women rippled out from behind the gilded lattice work and
silken curtains that surrounded the salon. The harem was present
though invisible to me. I felt like another being and executed
my tricks with more than usual effect. The Sultan was charmed
and paid me many compliments. A couple of
weeks after the <span class="xxpn" id="p229">{229}</span>
séance, I was invited to accompany him on a short cruise in the
royal yacht. On this occasion I created a profound sensation
by borrowing the Sultan’s watch, which I (apparently) threw
overboard. His face fairly blazed with anger; his hand involuntarily
sought the handle of his jeweled sword. Never before had
the Commander of the Faithful been treated so cavalierly. Seeing
his agitation, I hastened to explain. ‘Don’t be alarmed, your
Majesty, for the safety of your timepiece. It will be restored
to you intact. I pledge my honor as a magician.’ He sneered
incredulously, but vouchsafed no reply. ‘Permit me to throw
overboard this hook and line and indulge in a little fishing.’ So
saying, I cast into the sea the line, and after a little while brought
up a good sized fish. Cutting it open, I produced from its body
the missing watch. This feat, bordering so closely on the sorcery
of the Arabian Nights, made a wonderful impression on the
spectators. I was the lion of the hour. Constantinople soon
rang with my fame. In the cafés and bazaars the ignorant populace
discussed my marvelous powers with bated breath. The
watch trick, however, proved my undoing. One morning I was
sitting in my room at my hotel, idly smoking a cigarette and
building palaces as unsubstantial as those erected by the Genii in
the story of ‘Aladdin and his wonderful lamp,’ when a messenger
from his Imperial Majesty was announced. He made a low
obeisance and humbly laid at my feet a bag containing 5,000
piastres, after which he handed me an envelope inscribed with
Turkish characters and sealed with large seals.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Ah,’ I said to myself, ‘the Sultan is going to confer upon
me the coveted order of the Medjidie.’ My heart swelled with
pride. I was like the foolish Alnaschar, who, while indulging in
day dreams of greatness, unconsciously overturned his stock of
glassware in the market, thereby ruining himself. I prolonged
opening the envelope in order to indulge my extravagant fancies.
Finally I broke the seals and read the enclosed letter, which was
written in French:</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘It would be better for you to leave Constantinople at
once.’</p>

<p>“My budding hopes were crushed. I left the city that afternoon
in a British steamer bound for a
Grecian port. Either <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
watch tricks were unpopular in the Orient, or I was encroaching
upon the preserves of the Dervishes—a close corporation for the
working of pious frauds. But things have changed in Turkey
since then.”</p>

<p>Madame Herrmann, on the death of her husband, sent to
Europe for her nephew-in-law, Leon Herrmann, and they continued
the entertainments of magic throughout the country,
meeting with success. Some curious and amusing adventures
were encountered on their travels. One of Alexander Herrmann’s
favorite tricks was the production of a mass of colored
paper ribbon from a cocoanut shell, and from the paper a live
duck. This clever feat always evoked tremendous applause.
The stupid look of the duck as it waddled around the stage was
very laughable. On one occasion, when I was present at the
<i>soirée magique</i>, the duck seemed to find difficulty in reaching the
exit and went around quacking in loud distress, thereby interrupting
the conjurer in his patter. Quick as a flash, Herrmann
remarked to his assistant, “Kindly remove the comedian.”
Shouts of laughter greeted the sally. Herrmann was very felicitous
in this species of impromptu by-play. He was indeed, as
he described himself, the necromantic comedian. Leon, following
in the footsteps of his illustrious uncle, also performed the
cocoanut shell trick. He had as assistant a stalwart Ethiopian,
who had been with the elder Herrmann, and rejoiced in the
stage name of “Boumski.” One day in the city of Detroit, Mich.,
Madame Herrmann missed from her dressing room at the theatre
a valuable diamond ring. Suspicion fell upon the negro, who
had attained some proficiency in the <i>black</i> art, so far as making
things disappear was concerned, though he was not so apt when
it came to producing them. Boumski stoutly asseverated that he
had seen the duck swallow the ring. The fowl was accordingly
slain, and its stomach searched, but without result. The loss
of the duck caused considerable grief in the conjuring ménage.
It was quite a pet, and trained to perform its part in the magic
tricks. Suspicion again fell upon Boumski. Finally, the dusky
necromancer confessed that he was the thief and
that the poor <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
duck was innocent. The ring was recovered in a pawnbroker’s
shop. Boumski went to jail. To revenge himself he exposed the
whole repertoire of tricks of the Herrmann company to the
newspapers.</p>

<p>After playing together for a season or two, aunt and nephew
separated, today they are performing with great success in
vaudeville. Madame Herrmann calls her act “A Night in
Japan.” It is an exhibition of silent magic—<i>en pantomime</i>.
She was ever a graceful woman, and her exhibitions of legerdemain
are most pleasing. Beautiful scenery adds to the effect.
Leon Herrmann, who resembles his great uncle in personal
appearance, is fast becoming a favorite with the American public.</p>

<p>Let us now pass in review some of Alexander Herrmann’s
tricks. His gun illusion was perhaps his
most sensational feat. <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
I am indebted to the late Frederick Bancroft for the correct
explanation of the startling trick. A squad of soldiers, under
the command of a sergeant, comprised the firing party. The
guns were apparently loaded with genuine cartridges, the bullets
of which had been previously marked for identification by various
spectators. The soldiers stood upon a platform erected in the
centre of the theatre, and Herrmann stationed himself upon
the stage. The guns were fired at him, and he caught the balls
upon a plate. Upon examination the balls were found to be still
warm from the effects of the explosion, and the marks were
identified upon them. The substitution of the sham cartridges,
which were loaded into the gun, for the genuine ones was very
subtly executed by means of a trick salver having a small well
let into its centre to hold the cartridges. Into this well the
marked cartridges were deposited by the spectators. In the
interior of the salver was a second compartment loaded with the
blank cartridges. The sergeant who collected the bullets shifted
the compartments by means of a peg underneath the salver, as
he walked from the audience to the stage.
The sham cartridges <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span>
were now brought to view and the real were hidden in the body
of the salver. While the soldiers were engaged in loading their
rifles with the blank cartridges, the sergeant went behind a side
scene to get his gun and deposit the salver. A couple of assistants
extracted the genuine bullets and heated them. Herrmann
went to the wing to get the plate, and secretly secured the marked
bullets. The rest of the trick consisted in working up the dramatic
effects.</p>

<p>One of Herrmann’s best illusions, though not invented by
him, was his vanishing lady, known as “Vanity
Fair” and “After <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
the Ball.” A large pier glass, which was elevated some two feet
above the stage, was brought forward by the magician, and the
glass shown to be solid, back and front. Mme. Herrmann,
dressed in a handsome ball costume, was now introduced to the
audience. By the aid of a small ladder, she climbed up and
stood upon a glass shelf immediately in front of the mirror. A
narrow screen was then placed about her, so as not to hide from
the spectators the sides of the mirror.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Herrmann, “Madame Vanity
Fair, who is now gazing at her pretty features in the mirror, has
only to pronounce a certain mystic formula known to the Cabalists,
and she will be instantly transported to the grand ball at the
Opera House. This is a decided improvement on horses and carriages.”
He fired a pistol, and the screen was pulled away. The
lady was found to have completely vanished. But how? Not
into the mirror, into that land of adumbration, celebrated in
<i>Alice’s Adventures in a Looking Glass</i>. No, the glass was
apparently of solid crystal, and too thin to conceal anyone. This
is the <i>modus operandi</i> of the trick: The mirror in reality was
composed of two sections. The glass shelf, upon which the lady
stood, concealed the top of the lower section. The upper section
was placed to the rear of the lower mirror, so that its lower end
slid down behind it. This upper glass worked like a window
sash. When it was pushed up, its upper end was hidden in the
wide panel of the frame. The lower part of this large glass had
a piece cut out. Through this opening the lady was drawn by an
assistant across an improvised bridge—a plank shoved through
the back scene, as shown in the illustration. When she had
escaped, the counterpoised mirror was again pushed down
into its proper place, and the plank withdrawn. The fact
that some of the mirror was in view during the exhibition allayed
suspicion on the part of the audience. The effect was further
enhanced by turning the back of the mirror to the spectators to
show them that the lady was not there. It was one of the most
novel and effective illusions of Herrmann’s repertoire, particularly
because of the fact that he was assisted by his pretty and
graceful wife, who looked charming in her elegant ball dress,
and acted her part to perfection. <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span></p>

<h2 class="h2herein">A TWENTIETH CENTURY THAUMATURGIST.</h2>

<div class="depigraph">
<p class="pepigraph">“I have, since I was three years old, conversed
 with a magician, most profound in his art, and yet not
 damnable.”—<span class="smcap">S<b>HAKESPEARE</b>;</span>
 <i>As You Like It</i>—V. 2, 68.</p></div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">The leading exponent of the magic art in the United States
today is the famous Harry Kellar. He makes a specialty of
pseudo-clairvoyance, second sight, feats of levitation, spirit cabinets,
and mechanical illusions. Seizing upon the craze for
Hindoo necromancy, mahatma miracles and the like, he presents
many of his tricks and illusions as examples of Eastern thaumaturgy.
Unlike Herrmann, who bubbled over with wit and
humor and acted the comedian, Kellar assumes a Sphinx-like
demeanor and envelopes himself in a mantle of mystery. Herrmann
was the tricksy Mephistopheles of Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>. Kellar
is the Arbaces of Bulwer’s <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>—the Egyptian
sorcerer and initiate into the rites of Isis and Osiris; or, better
still, the Brahmin adept of Crawford’s <i>Mr. Isaacs</i>. Kellar’s
entertainments appeal to the scholarly inclined. To see him at
work, one is transported in imag­i­na­tion to a Hindoo temple
where mahatmas exhibit their miracles. His patter is more
or less based on Oriental ideas. For example, “The Yoge’s
Lamp,” which is a very fine trick, invented by a German conjurer,
Herr Conradi, of Berlin. The effect is as follows: On
a pedestal stands a lighted lamp. Enveloping this lamp with a
foulard, the magician carries it across the stage and places it upon
a small gueridon with a glass top. A portion of the chimney
of the lamp is in view all the time, and within the silken folds
of the foulard the light may be seen shining through with subdued
effect. Kellar now fires a pistol. The
foulard drops upon <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
the table, and the big lamp vanishes with lightning rapidity. It
seems to melt away. It is a seemingly impossible feat, because
the glass-topped table has no possible place of concealment about
it. The foulard is afterwards passed to the spectators for examination.
I am not at liberty to reveal the secret of this surprising
trick. I must preserve a discreet silence, in deference to the
wishes of Mr. Kellar. As originally invented by Herr Conradi,
the lamp reappears in a frame hanging in the center of the stage.
But Kellar’s method I consider more artistic, and in better
keeping with the <i>mise en scène</i>. Without patter this feat of
magic would fall comparatively flat. In Kellar’s hands it is
invested with a halo of supernaturalism which is very effective.
The following is a brief résumé of the story of the lamp: “Ladies
and gentlemen, I have here on this pedestal a copper lamp of
antique pattern which was loaned to me by a celebrated Brahmin
who presides over a shrine in the Holy City of Benares, India.
I have his permission to use it in my thaumaturgic séances, but
I must return it to him at a certain hour every evening, as it is
needed in the ceremonial rites of the temple at Benares. That
hour has now arrived. (<i>A bell strikes the hour, slowly and solemnly.
He wraps the foulard about the lamp, which he places
on the table.</i>) I shall count three—the mystic number
of Brahmin theosophy—and fire this pistol. Instantaneously the
atoms composing the lamp will be disintegrated by the force of
my will and fly through the fourth dimension of space to India,
where they will reassemble and materialize in their former shape,
and the lamp will appear upon the altar of the temple as of
old.”</p>

<p>Of course no one credits this rhodomontade, but the conjurer’s
purpose is accomplished. The trick is given a mystical
setting and a certain kind of pseudo-scientific explanation. And
all things are possible in nature, for have we not the x-rays,
radio-activity, wireless telegraphy, and forces undreamed of a
few years ago by the physicists?</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">II.</h3>

<p>Kellar was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1849—the famous
year of the California Argonauts. When quite a
young lad he
<span class="xxpn" id="p240">{240}</span>
was apprenticed to the drug business. In this respect he resembles
the great Cagliostro. One day while experimenting on his
own account, during the absence of his master, he charged a
copper vessel with soda and sulphuric acid, the result being a terrific
explosion which tore a hole in the office floor overhead.
Thus he began life by making a great noise in the world, and has
resolutely kept it up. After the fiasco with the chemicals, he was
dismissed by his employer, whereupon he boarded a freight train
and went to New York City, where he became a newsboy. His
energy and winning manners attracted the attention of Rev.
Robert Harcourt, an English clergyman, who adopted him, and
gave him a good education. The reverend gentleman intended
preparing young Kellar for the church, but such was not to be.
Seeing an advertisement in a Buffalo paper that the renowned
“Fakir of Ava” wanted a boy to travel with him and learn the
trade of magician, Kellar determined to apply for the place.
He set out for Buffalo and went to the Fakir’s bungalow, a
quaint old house in the environs of the city. “When he entered
the yard, the Fakir’s little black-and-tan dog jumped at him in
a friendly way, and showed great delight at the meeting. The
Fakir soon appeared, and after he had talked with the boy for a
short time, said: ‘I have had about one hundred and fifty applications
for the place, but that little dog has shown great animosity
to every boy who entered the gate until you came. You are
the first one he has made friends with. I will give you a trial.’&#x202f;”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn27" id="fnanc27">27</a>
The result was that Kellar became acolyte or familiar to the
Fakir of Ava, and all because of a dog. This was reversing the
old proverb, “Love me, love my dog” to that of “Whom my dog
loves, I love.” The reader will remember that Mephistopheles
first appears to Faust in the shape of a dog. Perhaps the Fakir’s
canine was possessed with the Devil, and recognized a future
master of the black art in Kellar.</p>

<i>A Magical Tour.</i> Chicago, 1886.</p></div>

<p>After traveling several seasons with the good old Fakir,
Kellar started out on his own account. It was an uphill fight.
He met the Davenport Brothers and Fay, alleged spirit mediums
but in reality clever conjurers, and joined them, first as assistant,
then as agent, and afterwards as business manager. He traveled
<span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
with them over the greater part of the United States (including
California) and Canada, over the Continent of Europe, through
Russia, via Riga, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nijni-Novgorod and
Odessa; thence back again to the United States. In the summer
of 1871 he piloted them through Texas. They traveled all over
that State in wagons. There was no railroad beyond Hearne
then, and their route was from Galveston to Houston, Columbus,
San Antonio, Austin, Lampasas Springs, Dallas, and Shreveport,
and thence by boat down the river to New Orleans.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1873, he left the Davenports, from whom he
learned the secrets of rope-tying and the cabinet act, and formed
a combination called Fay and Kellar. Eventually he went
into partnership with two Chinese magicians. This company
was known as the Royal Illusionists. After touring Australia,
India and China, Kellar dissolved partnership and came to the
United States. During his stay at Calcutta, India, the <i>Asian</i> of
Jan. 3, 1882, printed the following effusion, a paraphrase on
Robert Heller’s verse about himself and Anderson:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>For
 many a day,</div>
<div class="dpp00">We have heard people say</div>
<div class="dpp00">That a wondrous magician was Heller;</div>
<div class="dpp00">Change the H into K,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And the E into A,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And you have his superior in Kellar.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Kellar has written several monographs on his art—mainly
contributions to magazines; all highly suggestive and entertaining.
He says: “There are six qualifications which are the essence of the
successful magician, pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur, necromancer—call him what
you may. They are: The will, manual dexterity, physical strength,
the capacity to perform things automatically, an accurate,
perfectly ordered and practically automatic memory, and a knowledge
of a number of languages, the more the better.”</p>

<p>Speaking of his experiences as stage helper, or <i>chela</i>, to the
so-called Fakir of Ava, he says (<i>Independent</i>, May 28, 1903):
“The ‘face’ of many a pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur has been saved and his
defeat turned into a glorious victory by the merest chance. One
of my first adventures with the Fakir of Ava
affords a capital <span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span>
illustration. We were doing the watch trick—taking a timepiece
from some one in the audience, passing it upon the stage in
a platter, destroying both platter and timepiece in plain view of
the spectators, loading the fragments into a pistol, firing the
weapon at a target and bringing the watch—whole and sound—to
life again upon the face of the mark, in plain sight of the
audience. But on that particular day the target concluded not
to do its share of the performance. No watch would it produce;
the machinery was out of order. We had to work hard to ‘save
face.’</p>

<p>“Disguised as an usher of the house, I went down into the
audience with the timepiece, hoping to be able to slip it unobserved
into the pocket of the owner. He was sitting at a distance
from the aisle; I found it impossible. I did the next best thing—slipped
the watch into the waistcoat pocket of the man who sat
next to the aisle on the same row with the owner. Then I
returned to the stage.</p>

<p>“The Fakir in the meantime was discussing learnedly upon
some other subject. When I returned, the question of the whereabouts
of the watch was called up and a bell on the stage was
summoned to answer questions; one ring for ‘yes,’ two for ‘no.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Is the watch on the stage?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘No,’ replied the obedient bell.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Is it in the audience?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Is it on the first row?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘No.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘The second—the third, the fourth, the fifth?’</p>

<p>“To each question came a ‘no.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Is it on the sixth row?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Is it the first man on the row?’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“The eyes of the audience focused upon the unfortunate
occupant of the seat.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Look in your pocket, sir,’ said the Fakir of Ava, in his
politest, most persuasive tones. <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span></p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Go on with your show there and let me alone,’ shouted the
enraged seat holder.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘But I pray you, look in your pocket,’ said the Fakir.</p>

<p>“The man obeyed and produced the watch. The trick, called
in stage vernacular a ‘life saver,’ made a hit vastly more impressive
than the one originally planned but spoiled by the perverseness
of the target.”</p>

<p>Kellar’s greatest and most sen­sa­tional illu­sion is his
“lev­i­ta­tion”—raising a person and leaving him sus­pended in
mid-air with­out any ap­parent means of sup­port, seem­ingly
defying the law of grav­i­ta­tion. An explanation of this
sur­pris­ing feat is thus described by a writer in the
<i>Strand Magazine</i> (London):</p>

<p>“An assistant is introduced, laid upon an ottoman, and then
sent off into a hypnotic trance (?). The performer takes an
ordinary fan and fans the body while it rises slowly about four
feet in the air, where it mysteriously remains for any length of
time desired. A large solid steel hoop is given for examination,
and after the audience is satisfied as to its genuineness it is passed
over the body from head to feet, behind the body and over it
again, at once dispelling the idea of wires or any other tangible
support being used, the body, as it were, journeying through the
hoop each time. The suspended assistant is
now fanned from <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
above and gently descends to the ottoman as slowly and gracefully
as he rose from it. He is then brought back to his normal
state out of the trance, and walks off none the worse for his aerial
pose.</p>

<span class="smmaj">OR</span>
<span class="smcap">M<b>ECHANISM</b>?—W<b>HICH</b>?</span></div></div>

<p>“This seeming impossibility is performed by the aid of a
cranked bar (Fig. 2 and A, Fig. 3) and a pulley to raise it, the
bar being pushed through from the back at the moment when the
performer is ‘hypnotizing’ the subject, and in the act of placing a
light covering over him he guides a clamp (B, Fig. 3) and fixes
it to the top of the ottoman upon which the subject rests, and
which rises, unseen, with him, the edges being obscured by the
covering. The bar being the same color as the back scene cannot
be noticed, and resting upon a stand (C, Figs. 2 and 3) behind
the scenes the same height as the ottoman it is kept firm by the
aid of strong supports. Being also double the width (D, Fig. 3)
at this part greater leverage is obtained to hold the board upon
which the subject rests secure from tilting either way. By means
of a pulley arrangement (E, Fig. 2) the assistant behind raises
and lowers the body, looking through a small hole in the scene
and timing the performer’s movements with exactness. Fig. 1
shows the illusion as it appears. Fig. 2—a
side view—shows the <span class="xxpn" id="p245">{245}</span>
means of suspension and the pulley for raising the bar and telescopic
stand. Fig. 3 almost explains itself. It shows the method
of passing the ring over the body. By putting it on at (1) and
passing it as far as the center of the bar (A) it can be brought
around and off the body at (2), apparently having passed right
over it, although not free from the crank; it is then passed behind
the body as far as (3), when it can again be placed over the end
(1) and drawn across once more, this time being, of course, quite
free, having made an apparent circle right around and across the
body. It seems evident to the audience that the subject is so
raised and suspended by the performer’s magic power alone.</p>

<p>“The sleeping subject is now lowered, and in the act of being
‘dehypnotized’ the performer slips the crank off, which is immediately
drawn in from behind, the subject and performer sharing
the applause. It is almost needless to explain that the ‘hypnotism’
is mere sham to heighten the effect and admit of an
excuse to stoop in order to fix the cranked bar.”</p>

<p>So far, so good. The above method was undoubtedly the one
used in Mr. Kellar’s original presentation of the illusion. But
he has since made numerous improvements in it which have
puzzled not only the public but the conjurers as well.</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>Kellar has been an extensive Oriental traveler. He has
hob-nobbed with Hindoo Rajahs, smoked
nargilehs with the <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
turbaned Turk, and penetrated into darkest Africa. In India
he witnessed many exhibitions of thaumaturgy. Concerning
the high-caste magic, such as hypnotic feats and experiments
in apparent death, he speaks with respect, but the magic of the
strolling Fakirs he characterizes as inferior to that of our Western
conjurers, with, perhaps, the exception of the Hindoo Basket
Trick, which is a clever illusion. When we contemplate the
fact that this startling trick is always performed in the open
air, amid a circle of spectators, we must give due credit to the
histrionic ability of the native conjurers and their powers of
misdirection. Robert-Houdin and Col. Stodare introduced this
experiment to European theatre-goers, but they were aided by
all the accessories of the modern stage and the audience sat
at a respectable distance. Let us hear Kellar’s explanation of
the feat (<i>A Magician’s Tour</i>, Chicago, 1886).</p>

<p>“At Allahabad I saw a juggler who made a specialty of this
trick. Having explained to the spectators what he proposed
to do, he allowed them to select a spot on the turf in the open
air where the trick should be performed. Here he stationed
himself with a basket with a hinged lid at his feet, a little boy at
his side, and a sharp sword in one hand. He wore nothing
but a breech clout. The company surrounded the conjurer in
a circle so close that there was no possibility for any person
to pass it without detection. The juggler placed the child in
the basket, closed the lid, and began muttering a seeming incantation.
While still praying he wound a large white cloth about
his arm, and suddenly threw it over the basket, binding one end.
He then drew the cloth towards him, brought it up around his
waist and tucked the end in his clout, leaving a portion to hang
down in front in graceful folds. This much done, he plunged
the sword through the basket. As the child’s agonizing cries
were heard, the man drew back the sword all dripping with
blood. Again and again was the sword thrust into the basket,
the child’s heart-rending screams growing fainter and fainter
until they ceased altogether. The Fakir asked that the basket
be examined. It was opened and found to be empty. A gleeful
shout was heard. The spectators looked in the direction from
whence it came, and there sat the child on the limb
of a small <span class="xxpn" id="p247">{247}</span>
tree, waving his arms and seeming as happy as a bird. I paid
the thaumaturgist two rupees (one dollar) and the secret of the
trick was explained to me. I marveled at first that the man
was willing to reveal the mystery for so small a sum, but I
soon discovered that only those who wore the Indian juggler’s
costume, the breech clout, could perform it. The trick is done
in this way: When the cloth is spread the boy slips out of
the basket under the friendly cover of the linen, and crawls
under the Fakir. Grasping a strap about the man’s waist, he
draws himself up between the juggler’s legs. The cloth when
brought about the Fakir’s waist hides the little fellow, who,
from his unexpected retreat, utters the piercing shrieks of the
dying child. With a sponge saturated with a red liquid the
conjurer produces the blood stains. When the people rush
forward to look into the basket, the boy slips from his place
of concealment and makes his presence manifest wherever he
has been directed to go.”</p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p248">{248}</span></div>

<p>Herr Willmann describes practically the same trick under the
title “Spirit box,” designed to prove the permeability of matter.
A medium is placed in the box, and after some hocus-pocus the
manager reopens it and declares it to be empty; for the purpose
of proving his assertion he turns it over toward the public, and
when the lid is opened, the medium, who remains all the while in
his place, has become invisible, because he is hidden by the interior
part of the double wall, which now seems to be the bottom
of the box. The box stands upon a podium, in order to show
that the medium could not have escaped through the floor. The
adjoined illustration reveals the secret of the trick, the explanation
of which is as simple as the effect is surprising.</p>

<p>On stages which allow the pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur to use traps, a
trunk is placed so as to allow the prisoner to escape through
the floor. The movable wall of the trunk in such a case swings
round an axis which lies parallel with the rope that is afterwards
fastened around the trunk. The movable wall in the
trunk connects with a trap in the floor, and while visitors from
the audience closely watch the fastening, the enclosed person
makes his escape with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>Kellar is an expert in the rope-tying business, which the
notorious Davenport Brothers exploited under the guise of
spiritism. When I first saw Kellar at Ford’s Opera House,
Washington, D. C., in February, 1879, his cabinet act, a burlesque
on the Davenport séance, was a feature of his entertainment.
After playing a disastrous engagement in Philadelphia,
he came to Washington, where his business proved no better,
and being “flat broke,” as he expressed it, he advertised in
sheer desperation a Sunday night lecture on Spiritualism, to be
delivered at the old National Theatre. The theatre and advertising
were furnished by Mr. Ford, who took half of the gross
receipts. I was present on the occasion and recall the excitement.
Everything passed off without special incident, until
the magician came to the Davenport cabinet test. At this
juncture a venerable gentleman arose in the audience and challenged
Kellar to permit him to do the tying in the same manner
that he had tied the Davenports years before. The gentleman
was very much in earnest and remarked: “If you
fail to get <span class="xxpn" id="p249">{249}</span>
loose when tied, you are a colossal humbug; if you do get loose,
it will be by spirit agency.” Kellar joyfully accepted the challenge.
The old gentleman came upon the stage and pinioned
the magician’s hands behind his back with many intricate and
subtle knots. So tightly did he draw the
rope that sympathetic <span class="xxpn" id="p250">{250}</span>
people in the theatre cried, “Shame.” Having completed his
job, he turned to the spectators with a self-satisfied look on his
face, as much as to say, “I have trapped the fox.” But he
reckoned without his host. No sooner was his back turned
to the magician than the latter slipped one hand from its lashings
and tapped the skeptic on the shoulder. “If you have
two of my hands tied behind my back,” said Kellar, “I must
have been royally endowed by Nature with a third hand.”</p>

<p>Thunders of applause greeted the scene. Even ladies rose
from their seats and cheered. “Bravo, Kellar!” was heard on
all sides. The old gentleman joined in the demonstration, and
acknowledged himself beaten. This episode caused so great
a sensation in Washington that two more Sunday evening
lectures were given to crowded houses, and Kellar was enabled
to pay his debts and get out of town.</p>

<p>It is now pretty well known to conjurers that the Davenports
accomplished their feats by secretly taking up slack in the rope
while it was being tied, thereby getting a loop hole in the bonds
through which to work one hand loose. Frequently they cut
the cords with knives secreted up their sleeves, and after the
alleged spirit manifestations were gone through with, exchanged
the cut ropes for genuine ones, and came out of the cabinet
with these, making the spectators believe that some occult agency
had freed them from the knots.</p>

<p>There is a conjurer named Joad Heteb who claims to have
dropped from the eye of the Sphinx in the form of a tear, and
was immediately metamorphosed into the Wizard of the Pyramids.
According to his account the spirits of the sorcerers
and soothsayers of the olden Pharaohs left their rock-cut tombs
and painted mummy-cases to be present at the event. Joad
Heteb has a clever press-agent. If Joad fell from the Sphinx’s
eye in the shape of a tear, Kellar must have dropped from
the fabled monster’s mouth in the form of a <i>word</i>, and that
word “Mystery.” Kellar is ably assisted by Herr Valadon,
an Anglo-German professor of legerdemain, formerly of Egyptian
Hall, London. Valadon, upon his entrance on the stage,
takes off his gloves, vanishes them,
by apparently throwing <span class="xxpn" id="p251">{251}</span>
them in the air, whereupon a white dove flutters upwards. It
is a very pretty effect.</p>

<div class="depigraph">
<p class="pepigraph">“I could not remember any more than
that the hero [Cagliostro] had spoken of heaven, of the
stars, of the Great Secret, of Memphis, of the High Priest,
of transcendental chemistry, of giants and monstrous
beasts, of a city ten times as large as Paris, in the

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="pfirst">When Madame Blavatsky, High Priestess of Isis, died,
there followed a long interregnum during which magic languished.
Finally there appeared in the East a star of great
magnitude—the five-pointed star of the Gnostics and the Oriental
Mahatmas, heralding the coming of another mystic.
Madame Blavatsky had set the fashion for Thibetan adepts,
and had turned the current of modern occultism towards the
Land of the Lamas, so it was quite natural that the new thaumaturgist
should hail from the Holy City of Llassa. His
name was Monsieur le Docteur Albert de Sarak, Comte de
Das, who claimed to be “the son of a Rajah of Thibet and a
French Marchioness,” and to have been born in the land of
marvels.</p>

<p>Monsieur le Comte, in his circulars, described himself as
“General Inspector of the Supreme Council of Thibet.” He
carried about with him a voluminous portfolio of papers containing
“the numerous diplomas which he possessed as member
of several orders of knighthood and of scientific and humanitarian
associations.” He also exhibited a Masonic diploma of
the Thirty-third degree, which bore the endorsement of all the
Supreme Councils of the Rite to which he belonged in the
countries through which he had traveled. But he
was not a <span class="xxpn" id="p255">{255}</span>
Fellow of the Theosophical Society. On the contrary, he
claimed to have been persecuted by the members of that Brotherhood;
to have been frequently arrested and denounced by
them as a pretender to the occult, as a false magician, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Count made his début in Washington, D. C, in the
year 1902, where he founded one of his esoteric centers, described
as follows in the organ of his cult, <i>The Radiant Truth</i>,
of which he was editor-in-chief:</p>

<p>“Oriental Esoteric Head Centre of the United States of
America, under obedience to the Supreme Esoteric Council of
the Initiates of Thibet. Social object: To form a chain of
universal fraternity, based upon the purest Altruism, without
hatred of sect, caste or color; in which reign tolerance, order,
discipline, liberty, compassion and true love. To study the
Occult Sciences of the Orient and to seek, by meditation, concentration
and by a special line of conduct, to develop those
psychic powers which are in man and his environment.”</p>

<p>The Count also gave private séances, as we see by his advertisement
in the above-named journal:</p>

<p>“Science of Occultism, Double Vision, Telepathy, Astrology,
Horoscopy, etc. Doctor Albert de Sarak, Count de Das, General
Inspector of the Supreme Council of Thibet.</p>

<p>“Office hours: 3 to 5 p. m.</p>

<p>“Address, 1443 Corcoran Street, Washington, D. C.”</p>

<p>Dr. Sarak’s first public exhibition of his alleged psychic
powers is thus described in the <i>Washington Post</i> (March 16,
1902):</p>

<p>“Dr. A. de Sarak, occultist and adept, a professor of the
mystic and the sixth sense, gave a demonstration last night
before a Washington audience. Several hundred persons gathered
in the beautiful assembly hall of the House of the Temple
of the Supreme Council, Southern Jurisdiction, 433 Third street,
last evening, to witness his weird exhibition of occult powers.
After three hours spent in the presence of the East Indian,
the audience filed out with apparently something to think about
and ponder.</p>

<p>“Professor Sarak, while master of fourteen languages, does
not speak fluently the English language. Last
evening he spoke <span class="xxpn" id="p256">{256}</span>
in French, and a very charming young woman, also an adept,
but of English birth, acted as his interpreter. The Easterner,
a man of medium height, was attired in a gorgeous gown of
white silk, across the breast of which hung certain mystic emblems
of gold and silver. A loose, pale-yellow robe covered this
garment during most of the evening. He wore a white turban.
The adept wears a pointed black beard, which, with large,
languid brown eyes, gave fully the effect that one expects in a
student of the mystic schools of Thibet.</p>

<p>“The interpreter stated that Professor de Sarak was born in
Thibet and was descended from a noble French family. He
had devoted his life, she said, to the study of the occult, first
in the Thibetan schools and later with the ascetics hidden in the
mountains. He had visited almost every country on the globe,
spreading the occult science, which, she declared, some time
would bring a rich harvest to all mankind.</p>

<p>“As the professor finished his rapidly spoken French sentences
the young woman translated them to the hearers. Dr.
de Sarak described the sixth sense in man, saying that it was
second-sight, a latent and undeveloped force. He said he merely
wished to present the facts of his religion. He explained the
wonderful fluid force that existed. He said it is the force that
raised the huge stones in building the pyramids and is the
same force that brings the bird from the egg, the force which
gives man the power of rising as if filled with a buoyant
gas, a power which can be concentrated in a tube. He stated
that occultism was absolutely nothing but the powers of the will.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘It is nothing supernatural,’ the doctor said, ‘but is merely
the hastening of nature’s work.’</p>

<p>“A small table stood by a leather chair, and on this burned
a tiny candle from the mouth of a brazen asp. The professor
stood over the table and busied himself with a pungent incense
in an odd burner. A glass plate, with a number of fish eggs,
was shown and examined. A large glass bowl was filled with
water, and one of the members of the audience was told to
carefully brush the eggs into the water. In the meantime three
men from the audience had with strong
ropes securely bound <span class="xxpn" id="p257">{257}</span>
the hands of the adept behind his back as he sat in the chair.
Broad, clean, white cloths were wrapped about the seated figure,
leaving the head free, and the three men selected held the cloths
in place. Music rolled from a deep organ, and the head of the
adept sank back and a strange light appeared to cross his face.
According to the directions of the interpreter the bowl of water
containing the fish eggs was placed by one of the three beneath
the cloths on the lap of the adept.</p>

<p>“After a period of straining and soft moaning from the
white-wrapped figure, for perhaps ten minutes, the cloths were
removed, and from the lap of the apparently insensible man was
lifted the bowl of water, but instead of the eggs which it contained
a few moments before there swam about a dozen of tiny,
new-born fish.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn28" id="fnanc28">28</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc28" id="fn28">28</a>
This reminds one of the experiments of Prof. Jacques
Loeb, of the University of Chicago, with the unfertilized eggs
of the sea urchin. There was nothing occult, however, in the
professor’s researches.</p></div>

<p>“Dr. Sarak was then blindfolded with a half-dozen bandages
pressing against absorbent cotton, which rested before
the eyes. For a while he remained in his chair, while the vibrating
tones of an organ filled the room. Then the adept suddenly
arose and walked surely and steadily down the room, turning
into narrow aisles through the audience as safely as a man might
who had his sight. This experiment was to demonstrate double
vision at a distance and through opaque bodies. A blank canvas
stood on an easel near the adept. Apparently in a trance, he
walked to the easel, mixed colors, and in ten minutes a finished
picture was the result. A game of dominoes was played with
a member of the audience, and previous to the beginning of the
game the doctor wrote something on a bit of card and his assistant
handed it to someone in the audience to keep. Blindfolded
and standing, the adept played the game perfectly, and at the
conclusion the card was found to contain the numbers of the
last two dominoes played by both the adept and his opponent.</p>

<p>“Experiments were given at the close in the disintegration
and restoration of matter, of psychic perception, in which he
aroused the wondering admiration of the audience.” <span class="xxpn" id="p258">{258}</span></p>

&#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a;</p>

<p>We have <i>read</i> that men tried to destroy them, casting
the stones of calumny and vengeance; and we have <i>seen</i>
them, even though weeping inwardly, gather up the stones,
asking pardon for those who threw them! <span class="xxpn"
id="p259">{259}</span></p>

<p>We have, in short, <i>read</i> lies, and we have <i>seen</i> them
present the Truth! &#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a;</p>

<p>Therefore, this Commission, animated by the most
sincere and reasoned faith, strong in the Right which
supports it, for Truth and for Justice, makes an appeal
to all those who know that to <i>Think</i> is to <i>Create</i>, to
<i>Create</i> is to <i>Love</i>, and that to <i>Love</i> is to <i>Live</i>;—to
unite themselves with us in a truly fraternal chain, not
formed of links of iron which can be broken, but woven of
flowers of the soul—a chain which knows neither hatred nor
deceit!</p>

<p>From those who come to us we will ask no sacrifices but
sincerity and good faith, which we will put to the test; we
respect all creeds and customs, but we banish hypocrisy and
slander!</p>

<p><i>Strong in our Right, invested with the powers
bequeathed to us by Him who had the power to give them</i>,
we initiate here in the Capital of the United States, in
the heat of the fire of our enemies, this movement of true
progress, destined to perpetuate the work of the Adept who
has just left us!</p>

<p>They, our enemies, have insulted him, calumniated him,
have abandoned him, because he was an obstacle to them; for
the Centres which radiate artificial light are afraid of
the Radiant Centre of Truth!</p>

<p>“The Radiant Truth” shall be our device, and with it we will go, with
our Venerated Master, “Forward, ever forward!”</p>

<p>Therefore let those who truly desire to learn and to elevate their spirit,
without fear and without care, and they will find Brothers, true Brothers!</p>

<p>Let those who have betrayed and insulted our Master, whom we will now
name,</p>

<div><span class="smmaj">OUR BROTHER, DR. SARAK,</span></div>

<p class="pcontinue">know:
that we have in our ranks persons who, having belonged to Theosophical
Societies, have torn up their diplomas, not caring to appear in the
list of those who, under pretext of justice and under the false name of Fraternity,
defame, calumniate and insult those whose mission is sublime.</p>

<p>Let those, in short, who wish to know &#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a; many other things, come
to us! &#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a;&#xa0;&#x2a; and we will prove to them both the Supreme Council and the
Radiant Truth, and, lastly, also our powers!</p>

<p>We make, then, an appeal, in view of the preceding considerations, to
all those who, even if belonging to other organizations, wish to unite with
us frankly and sincerely, and we can assure them that later they will thank
us with all their hearts.</p>

<p>This will afford them the most conclusive proof of the protection and
aid of those Masters or Guides who direct us.</p>

<p>Our Order will publish an official Review, which will have so much
success and be so well received that we shall be compelled to reprint it twice.</p>

<p>In this Review, whose propaganda name will be <i>The Radiant Truth</i>,
will be found all that the most eager student of Occult Truth can desire,
for, aside from the Esoteric work, which we have in reserve, we possess
documents of inestimable value, which will be published.</p>

<p>Only the members of our Order will have the right to our studies and
Esoteric demonstrations of a more advanced degree.</p>

<p>A Convention will be held at Washington at a convenient time, and a
Commission of delegates and members of the Order will
be sent to the <span class="xxpn" id="p260">{260}</span>
East to receive instructions and orders from those who direct the spiritual
future of the Race of Evolution—this in spite of all Theosophical or sectarian
societies and of those who do not desire the Light.</p>

<p>Those, then, who wish to make part of our Order, as Active or Militant
Members, or as Correspondents or Delegates, should send in their applications
to the General Secretary of the Commission, &#x2a;&#xa0;*&#xa0;*&#xa0;*

<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>I consulted with my friend, Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins, a clever
journalist and interested inquirer into the methods of spiritists
and occultists, and we decided to investigate Dr. Albert de Sarak,
the Thibetan adept. Mr. Watkins was to go first and have an
interview with him, with the idea of exploiting the Count in a
newspaper article on modern magic and theosophy; eventually
we were to attend one of the mystic’s séances together. I shall
let Mr. Watkins tell the story in his own words:</p>

<p>“I addressed a letter to Dr. Sarak by post requesting an
appointment. I received a prompt response in the form of a
courteous note, headed ‘Oriental Esoteric Center of Washington,’
and which commenced: ‘Your letter, which I have received,
reveals to me a man of noble sentiments.’ An hour was named
and the letter bore the signature, ‘Dr. A. Count de Sarak,’
beneath which were inscribed
several Oriental characters. <span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span></p>

<p>“I found Monsieur le Comte’s house in Corcoran street, late
in the appointed afternoon. It was a two-story cottage of yellow
brick with English basement, and surmounting the door was
an oval medallion repeating the inscription of Monsieur’s letterhead.
A young woman with blonde hair and blue eyes responded
to my ring. I was invited upstairs, she following. Before me
was the mind picture of a Lama with yellowed and wrinkled
visage, vested in folds of dingy red, with iron pencase at his
side and counting the beads of a wooden rosary; a Yoge of the
great hills; who should say to me, ‘Just is the wheel,’ or ‘Thou
hast acquired merit.’</p>

<p>“I was directed to the door of the rear parlor on the main
floor, and as I opened it there sat before me, at a modern roller-top
desk, a man of slender build and medium height, but with
one of the most striking physiognomies I have ever beheld.</p>

<p>“The face was that of a sheik of the desert. The hair was
of the blackest and so was the beard, sparse at the side but rather
full in front and not long. The eyes were huge, languid and
dreamy; the forehead, bared by the training of the hair straight
back, was high and bisected by a vein falling vertically between
prominences over the brows. The nose was strongly aquiline,
and the complexion was more that of the Oriental than of the
Latin. The man wore a long, black frock-coat of the mode
and faultless in fit; his trousers and waistcoat were of a rough
gray cloth.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Comte rose. The hand which grasped mine
was small and soft. He bowed, pointed to a seat and apologized
for his crude English, explaining that he preferred to talk
to me through an interpreter. The young woman who had
ushered me into the presence of Monsieur seated herself at his
side and explained that, although ‘the doctor’ had mastered fourteen
tongues, the English had been the most difficult of all for
him to fathom. After a pause, Monsieur addressed me in
French. The interpreter rolled her blue eyes slightly upward
and assumed the gaze of one seeing far away into the sky,
through the wall before her—an expression which she seldom
changed during
the entire interview. <span class="xxpn" id="p262">{262}</span></p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Through my power of second sight was revealed to me
your mission before you arrived,’ was the interpretation. ‘And
now that you come, a good spirit seems to attend you, and I
know that you come as a friend. I assure you also that I welcome
you as a friend.’ The translations were made a sentence
at a time.</p>

<p>“I assured Monsieur that this was deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>“I asked him if it might be my good fortune to witness
some of his esoteric manifestations, such as I had heard of his
performing.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘In the beginning,’ he continued, ‘I gave some public tests.
But now I am engaged in the serious work of teaching, and my
time is devoted entirely to the work. If Monsieur pleases, we
would welcome his presence as an honorary member of our
center. The diploma will cost him nothing. It is a rule of the
center that none may attend except members. His diploma will
entitle him to attend all our meetings as a spectator. We meet
every Wednesday night.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘All that we will require of Monsieur is that he endeavor
to learn, and to describe what he sees with absolute truth.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘I would ask M. le Docteur if he be a Buddhist,’ I said.
The question was suggested by a picture of Buddha upon the
wall before me.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Yes, Monsieur, I am a Buddhist, as are my masters in
Thibet. Understand, however, that this is not a religion which
I am here to teach, but a science—the science of the soul—which
does not conflict with any religion. I simply demonstrate
to them the powers which I have learned from my masters.’</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘What is your opinion of Mme. Blavatsky?’ was asked.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘She was a good person—what shall I say?—was good-hearted.
She endeavored to enter Thibet, but was unsuccessful.
None of the Theosophists have ever learned from my masters.
While Mme. Blavatsky lived, however, the Theosophical Society
seems to have worked in harmony. Now that she is dead, they
are divided by hatred and ill-feeling.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Once when I was in Paris, the Theosophists, hearing that
I was from Thibet, asked me to become an honorary member
of their society, just as I invite you,
Monsieur. I accepted <span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span>
their diploma, as courtesy demanded. I attended a congress
in Paris. One speaker mounted the tribune and stated that
there was a gentleman from Thibet present who could vouch
for their connection with the masters. I was a young man then—let
me see—it was about seventeen years ago, but now the
weight of fifty years hangs on my shoulders. My young blood
boiled and I rushed to the tribune and denounced the statement
as false. The Theosophists expelled me from their society—which
I had never sought to enter,’ and here he shrugged his
shoulders, ‘and since then, they have waged against me a relentless
campaign of calumny. In Europe, in South America—everywhere—follows
me a trail of circulars and letters published
by base calumniators. But still I have gone on with my work,
founding centers over the world. I have founded many in
South America, but this is the first in this country.’</p>

<p>“I ventured to console the count with words to the effect
that all great causes had grown out of persecution. When the
interpreter translated these sentiments, Monsieur, who sat at his
desk, assumed an expression of extreme pain and half closing
his eyes fixed his gaze upon a strange instrument reposing upon
the window sill. It was a piece of colored glass with a pebbled
surface held upright by a metal support. The interpretation
of my words was repeated, but Monsieur raised one finger,
continuing his stare of mixed concentration and suffering.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘He is now receiving an interpretation from his masters,’
the interpreter told me in a low voice. I did not notice it and
interrupted him. The doctor maintained his weird stare for
a few minutes, during which I heard from his corner of the
room a vibrating sound such as is produced by a Faradic battery.
Monsieur rose from his reverie with a sigh and hastily
wrote something upon a sheet of paper upon his desk. Then
he resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Fortunately I have preserved extracts from all of the journals
which have been friendly to me,’ he said. I was shown a
shelf full of scrap-books and the translations of numerous clippings
from foreign journals. One of these, credited to the Paris
<i>Figaro</i>, 1885, described experiments in ‘Magnetism and Fascination’
performed by Dr. de Sarak before
a committee of <span class="xxpn" id="p264">{264}</span>
scientists and journalists, during which he hypnotized a cage
full of live lions. There were many such accounts, including
a description of demonstrations made before the Queen of
Spain in 1888; another before the King of Portugal the same
year. An article credited to <i>La Révue des Sciences de Paris</i>,
November 7, 1885, stated that in the Grand Salle de la Sorbonne,
Count Sarak de Das, in the presence of the Prince of Larignans
and 1,400 people, caused his body to rise in the air about two
meters and to be there suspended by levitation.</p>

<p>“It was agreed that my name should be presented to the
council as suggested, and two days later I received a letter notifying
me of my election as honorary member of the center,
congratulating me thereupon and inviting me to be present at
the next meeting. I was given the privilege of bringing a friend
with me. I informed Mr. Evans, and we agreed to attend the
next séance, and make careful mental notes of the events of the
evening.”</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>Mr. Watkins and I went together on the appointed evening
to the house of the Mage, located in quaint little Corcoran street.
It was a stormy night, late in November; just the sort of evening
for a gathering of modern witches and wizards, in an up-to-date
<i>Walpurgis Nacht</i>. We were admitted by the interpreter and
secretary, whom I afterwards learned was Miss Agnes E. Marsland,
graduate of the University of Cambridge, England.</p>

<p>In the back parlor upstairs we were greeted by the Doctor,
who wore a sort of Masonic collar of gold braid, upon which
was embroidered a triangle. He presented us to his wife and
child, who were conspicuously foreign in appearance, the latter
about five years old. We were then introduced to an elderly
woman, stout and with gray hair, who, we were told, was the
president of the center. She wore a cordon similar to Dr.
Sarak’s, and soon after our arrival she rapped with a small
gavel upon a table, located in the bay window of the front drawing-room.</p>

<p>When she called the meeting to order the Doctor seated himself
upon her right, and at her left—all
behind the table—were <span class="xxpn" id="p265">{265}</span>
placed two other women, wearing large gold badges. The
interpreter seated herself against the wall beside the Count.
Shortly a fifth woman appeared. The Count’s wife and child
sat quietly upon a sofa in the corner behind him. In the seats
arranged along the walls for the audience sat only myself, Mr.
Watkins, and a reporter for the <i>Washington Times</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>mise en scène</i> was well calculated to impress the spectators
with a sense of the occult and the mysterious. The table
was draped with a yellow cloth, upon which were embroidered
various cabalistic symbols. Upon it stood an antique brazier
for burning incense, and a bronze candelabra with wax lights
arranged to form a triangle. Against the wall, just back of the
presiding Mistress of Ceremonies and the little French Mage,
was a niche containing a large gilt image of the Buddha, who
smiled placidly and benignly at the strange gathering. The
walls of the drawing-room were draped with rich Oriental rugs
and hung with allegorical paintings. The faint aroma of incense
soon permeated the atmosphere; there was a moment of profound
silence while the thaumaturgist meditatively consulted a
big volume in front of him—a work on mysticism by either
Papus or Baraduc, I forget which. I closed my eyes drowsily.
In imag­i­na­tion I was transported back into that dead past of the
Eighteenth century. I was in Paris, at a certain gloomy mansion
in the Rue St. Claude. I saw before me a table covered
with a black cloth, embroidered with Masonic and Rosicrucian
symbols; upon it stood a vase of water; lights burned in silver
sconces; incense rose from an antique brazier. And behold—Cagliostro,
necromancer and Egyptian Freemason, at his incantations.
The phan­tas­ma­goria fades away. I am back again in
Washington, and Sarak is speaking rapidly in French. I shall
quote as follows from Mr. Watkins’ note-book:</p>

<p>“The Doctor spoke of a membership of forty-two persons
and his disappointment that only six were present. He then
commenced in French a long discourse, citing the alleged experiments
of Baraduc on the soul’s light, and mentioning the
psychic researches of Flammarion. He stated that Marconi
had made partial progress in the science of transmitting intelligence
without wires, but that his masters had long
known of a <span class="xxpn" id="p266">{266}</span>
more simple method. He described the failures of foreigners
to penetrate into Thibet, stating that his masters there were able
to place a fluidic wall before any man or beast.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn29" id="fnanc29">29</a>
The women
watched their hierophant with intense fascination, save the interpreter,
who maintained her saintly gaze up into space, and the
wife, who sat by in sublime nonchalance.</p>

<p>“The Doctor then passed into a rear room, donned a long
robe of light blue material and returned with the piece of colored
glass which I had seen during my previous visit. It was
still flitted to the metal support, and with it he brought a bar
magnet. He placed the glass upon the table before him, making
many passes over it with his fingers, sometimes rubbing them
upon his gown as if they were burned. He explained that he had
sensitized the glass with a secret fluid which remained thereon
as a film. He drew a sort of tripod upon paper and placed the
glass and magnet alongside.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘I demonstrated at the last meeting how this power—which
I called ‘yud’—could be exerted against human beings.
You remember that I caused the man to fall from his bicycle.
Tonight I will exert the power against an animal,’ said the
fantaisiste.</p>

<p>“He stated that the lights would all be extinguished; that
those present would be stationed at the front windows; that at
a given signal he would cause a horse passing the street to halt
and remain motionless, to the amazement of the driver. Turning
to me, he asked, ‘Would Monsieur prefer that the horse be
passing eastward or westward?’ ‘Eastward,’ I said.</p>

<p>“Then the lights were put out, but previously his wife had
retired, ostensibly to put to bed the boy, who had grown sleepy.
All of the members present and the young man—a stranger,
evidently a reporter—were posted at the front windows. My
companion and I were stationed at two windows within a small
hall room adjoining. We were all asked to maintain absolute
silence. Vines covered both windows of our room and a street
lamp burned before the house to our right.
The wait was long, <span class="xxpn" id="p267">{267}</span>
probably twenty minutes, before the first vehicle ventured
through the block.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc29" id="fn29">29</a>
Since Dr. Sarak’s séance, Col. Younghusband and a
column of British soldiers have penetrated into the holy city of
Llassa without difficulty. The fluidic walls of the masters have
not impeded the progress of the British in the least degree.</p></div>

<p>“It was a buggy, drawn by a single horse, but, alas! it proceeded
westward. In it were seated two figures, whom I could
not see—both enshrouded in darkness.</p>

<p>“My impatience was now well nigh unbearable. In a few
minutes, however, I heard the clatter of hoofs from the opposite
direction—eastward.</p>

<p>“A buggy with a single horse came into view. One figure
wore a white fascinator or shawl about the head. The other
was a man. The horse slowed into a walk just before reaching
the house. It halted directly in front of us, then backed a few
feet and the rear wheel went upon the sidewalk opposite.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘What’s de mattah wid dat hoss?’ said a negro voice.
‘Nebber seen him act dat way befo’!’ The horse stood still for
a minute; then the driver clucked him up and he proceeded on
his way. It was too dark to see the positions of the reins or the
features of either occupant of the vehicle. Soon afterward
Madame de Sarak returned with the child and pointed toward
him, as if to say: ‘See, he has recovered from his sleepy spell!’</p>

<p>“At this point the Doctor retired and returned gowned in
white. He passed to us a canvas such as is commonly used by
painters in oil. He placed this upon an easel. At his right was
a table bearing brushes and two glasses filled, one with dark
blue and the other with white paint. He then distributed large
napkins among those present and handed to me two balls of
absorbent cotton. These I was told to place over his eyes, and
as I did so the two other men and several of the women bound
the napkins over the cotton. They were tied very tightly and two
were crossed. We inspected the bandages and pronounced them
secure. Then the white-robed figure, in this grotesque headgear,
asked me to lead him to an arm-chair in the far end of
the rear apartment, which I did. Seated in the chair, his chin
hanging down upon his breast, he remained for some time, until
suddenly he arose and walked straightway to his wife and child,
who were sitting behind the table in the front room, upon the
sofa as previously. He knelt before them, kissed the little one,
his back being toward us the while. Then
he walked directly <span class="xxpn" id="p268">{268}</span>
to my companion and took the latter’s watch from his pocket
without fumbling. He now proceeded to the easel, and, selecting
a brush from the table, dipped into the blue paint and printed
across the top of the canvas ‘Fifteen Minutes.’ I looked at my
companion’s watch and it registered half past 10. Evidently the
words denoted the time in which the picture was to be painted.
One of the women present requested that a moonlight scene in
Thibet be reproduced. Sudden movements of two brushes,
dipped in the two colors, transformed the letters into a clouded
sky through which a moon was bursting. Below was outlined
a sort of tower, to the left of which was painted a tree. After
some detail in the picture was outlined in blue, for example,
the white paint would be applied in lines exactly parallel to the
first, and many such touches of the brushes indicated that the
painting was not made as the result of memory alone. Near
the end of the painting the Doctor again approached his wife
and child, leading the latter to the easel and placing him upon
a chair before it.</p>

<p>“The child was given a brush and dabbed paint upon various
parts of the picture. Sometimes he seemed to be guiding his
father’s hand, but during this operation the latter was not doing
difficult work. All the while the adept was chanting something
which the child repeated. The picture was signed with Oriental
symbols placed in one corner. Then the painter made a gesture
of great fatigue, sighed very audibly and staggered into the
rear room. He fell upon a sofa near the door and motioned to
have the bandages removed. I removed some, assisted by his
wife, who brought him a glass of water. The cotton was in its
place as far as I could see. His eyes remained closed after they
were uncovered, and his attitude was that of a man who had
fainted. His wife held the water to his lips, and then, lifting
each of his eyelids, blew into them. Then the Mage arose and,
complaining of fatigue, resumed his seat behind the table.
Shading his eyes with his hand, he looked toward the canvas,
saying: ‘Behold the house in Thibet where I was initiated into
the mysteries of the Mahatmas.’</p>

<p>“After the exhibition of ‘double vision’ De Sarak performed
the cigarette paper test. <span class="xxpn" id="p269">{269}</span></p>

<p>“He concluded the séance with a brief speech, in which he
stated that it was customary to take up a collection for charity
at each meeting. A small cloth bag was passed by one of the
women. The secretary announced that $1.62 had been realized.
Then the president pounded with her gavel and adjourned the
meeting. The secretary ushered us to the door, and we went
out into the darkness.</p>

<p>“Such were the miracles of the adept Albert de Sarak, Comte
de Das, and such was his propaganda.”</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">V.</h3>

<p>Is it not strange that people can take such performances seriously?
The cigarette test—an old one—and familiar to every
schoolboy who dabbles in legerdemain, was a mere trick, dependent
upon clever substitution and palming. The absurd
splatterdash which the Mage painted while blindfolded had
nothing of Thibetan architecture about it, but resembled a
ruined castle on the Rhine. That he was able to peep beneath
his bandages at one stage of the proceedings seems to me evident.
He perhaps arranged this while kissing and fondling the
little child. Long practice, however, would enable him to paint
roughly while his eyes were bandaged. The horse episode was
of course a pre-arranged affair, yet I admit it was very well
worked up and gave one a creepy feeling—thanks to the <i>mise
en scéne</i>. But the Comte de Sarak has other occult phenomena
up his sleeve, which I have not yet witnessed—among them being
the shattering of a pane of glass by pronouncing the words,
“Forward, ever forward”; the instantaneous production of vegetation
from the seed; and the immediate development of fish
from spawn. He doubtless owes much of his notoriety to the
newspapers, which herald his alleged feats of magic in sensational
style.</p>

<p>A few months after my séance at the adept’s house, the
Washington papers announced the fact that the Count de Sarak,
the famous magician, was projecting a personally conducted tour
to the Orient for the members of his cult and all
those who were <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span>
interested in occultism. The pilgrims were to visit the inaccessible
shrines, pagodas, crypts, and lamaseries of the East, under
the ciceronage of the Count, who doubtless was to break down
for them by sheer force of will the fluidic barriers that surround
Lhassa, Thibet, where dwell the Mahatmas, in order that the
tourists might penetrate into the sacred city.</p>

<p>I never heard of anybody leaving Washington to go on this
expedition, except the Count—and he, I understand, got no
farther than New York City, where the French <i>table d’hôte</i>
abounds, and magic and mystery are chiefly to be studied in the
recipes of French
<i>chefs de cuisine</i>.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Imro Fox, “the comic conjurer,” was born May 21, 1852,
in Bromberg, Germany. He came to the United States in 1874,
and after serving as a <i>chef de cuisine</i> in several New York hotels,

of the old Hotel Lawrence, a famous resort for vaudeville

came to the city, having as its bright, particular star a magician.
The man of mystery, alas, was addicted to the flowing bowl,
and went on a spree after the first night’s performance. The
manager of the troupe, who was staying at the Lawrence, was in
despair. He told his woes to the proprietor of the hotel, who
informed him that the <i>chef</i> of the establishment was a conjurer.
Descending to the “lower regions” (a capital place, by the way,
in which to seek a disciple of the black art), the theatrical man
discovered the genial Imro studying a big volume. Near by
a black cat sat blinking at him. Upon the stove was a huge
caldron. The <i>mise en scène</i> of the place was decidedly that
of a wizard’s studio. But things are seldom what they seem.</p>

<p>The book which Fox was so industriously conning proved
to be a dictionary of the French language, not a black-letter tome
on sorcery. The <i>chef</i> was engaged in making up a ménu card,
in other words, giving French names to good old Anglo-Saxon
dishes. The caldron contained soup. The cat was the regular
feline habitué of the kitchen, not an imp
or familiar demon. <span class="xxpn" id="p272">{272}</span></p>

<p>“The <i>chef</i>, I believe,” said the manager, politely.</p>

<p>“I am,” said Fox.</p>

<p>“You are an amateur conjurer?”</p>

<p>“I amuse myself with legerdemain occasionally.”</p>

<p>“You’re the man I’m looking for. I am the proprietor of
a vaudeville company playing at .&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;. The gentleman who
does the magic turn for me has disappeared; gone on a prolonged
debauch.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” interrupted Imro, “a devotee of the ‘inexhaustible
bottle’ trick.”</p>

<p>“I want you to take his place,” said the manager, “and fill
out the week’s engagement. I will arrange matters with the
hotel proprietor for you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Donner und Blitzen!</i>” cried Fox. “Why, I never was on
a stage before in my life. I’d die with fright. Face an audience?
I’d rather face a battery of cannons.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” answered the theatrical man. “Do help me like
a good fellow. It will be money in your pocket.”</p>

<p>After considerable persuasion, Fox consented. The culinary
department was turned over to an assistant. That night Imro
appeared on the stage, habited in a hired dress suit that did not
fit him like the proverbial “paper on the wall.” With fear and
trembling he made his bow, and broke the ice by the following
allusion to his very bald pate: “Ladies and gentlemen, why is
my head like Heaven?&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;. You give it up! Good! Because
there is no parting there!” Amid the shout of laughter occasioned
by this conundrum, Fox began his card tricks. In the
argot of the stage, he “made good.”</p>

<p>This event decided him; he abandoned cooking for conjuring;
ménu cards for the making of programmes.</p>

<p>His entertainment is quite original. The curtain rises on
a gloomy cavern. In the middle is a boiling caldron, fed by
witches <i>à la</i> Macbeth. An aged necromancer, dressed in a long
robe with a pointed cap on his head, enters. He begins his
incantations, whereupon hosts of demons appear, who dance
about the caldron. Suddenly amid the crash of thunder and
a blinding flash of light, the wizard’s cave is metamorphosed
into a twentieth century drawing-room, fitted
up for a <span class="xxpn" id="p273">{273}</span>
conjuring séance. The decrepit sorcerer is changed into a gentleman
in evening dress—Mr. Fox—who begins his up-to-date
entertainment of modern magic. Is not this cleverly conceived?</p>

<p>A few thumbnail sketches of some of the local magicians of
New York City will not come amiss. First, there is Elmer P.
Ransom, familiarly known as “Pop.” He was born in <i>old</i> New
York, not far from Boss Tweed’s house. He still lives in that
quaint part of the city. He knows New York like a book. Once
he guided me through the Jewish ghetto, the Italian and Chinese
quarters. It was a rare treat. Ransom is a good all around
magician, who believes in the old school of apparatus combined
with sleight of hand. And so do I.</p>

<p>Next we have Adrian Plate, who was born in Utrecht, Holland,
in 1844. His rooms in upper New York are the Mecca of
all visiting magicians. He has a fine collection of books on
magic, and a scrap-book <i>par excellence</i>. Thanks to this clever
conjurer, I have secured translations of rare and curious Dutch
works on necromancy. Plate has always something new up his
sleeve.</p>

<p>T. Francis Fritz (Frank Ducrot) edits <i>Mahatma</i>, a magazine
for magicians, and is a good conjurer.</p>

<p>Sargent, the “Merry Wizard,” and second president of the
S. A. M., is an adept in the psychology of deception and a recognized
authority on the subject of patter. His articles on magic,
published in <i>Mahatma</i>, are very interesting. He wields a facile
pen as well as a wand, and like Silas Wegg occasionally drops
into poetry. His poetical effusion, “In Martinka’s Little Back
Shop,” brought out some years ago in <i>Mahatma</i>, has been widely
copied.</p>

<p>Henry V. A. Parsell, for a number of years the archivist of
the S. A. M., is a devotee of magic and freemasonry; a student
of the occult; and a mechanical engineer by profession. He is
especially fond of electrical tricks. He signs himself <i>Paracelsus</i>,
not that he has any special love for the Bombast of Hohenheim,
but because the name is a euphonic paraphrase of his own cognomen,
and redolent of sorcery. <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span></p>

<p>Dr. Golden Mortimer, first president of the S. A. M., is a
gentleman of culture. He was born in New York City, December
27, 1854. He began life as a magician, and was a pupil of
Robinson, the Fakir of Vishnu. He eventually toured the country
with an entertainment of the Heller order, known as “Mortimer’s
Mysteries,” and was very successful. Graduating finally
as a physician, he abandoned the <i>art magique</i> as a profession.</p>

<p>Krieger, the arch-master of cup-and-ball conjuring, the successor
of Bosco, often drops into Martinka’s. He is of Jewish
birth. With his little family he travels about, giving exhibitions
of his skill, at summer hotels, seaside resorts, clubs, lyceums,
etc. The errant propensities of the Krieger <i>ménage</i> gained for
it the sobriquet of the “Wandering Few,” a paraphrase of the
title of Eugene Sue’s weird novel, <i>The Wandering Jew</i>. To
listen to Krieger’s funny accent; to see him shake his bushy locks;
to watch his deft fingers manipulate the little cork balls, is to
enjoy a rare treat. When the small balls grow to large ones and
finally change into onions, potatoes, lemons, and apples you are
quite ready to acknowledge that Krieger’s art is the acme of
legerdemain.</p>

<p>But the prince of Hanky Panky is undoubtedly Nate Leipziger.
For close work with cards, coins, watches, handkerchiefs,
and the like he is pre-eminent in this country, perhaps in any
country. His great forte is amusing after-dinner parties. His
art is extremely subtle and indetectable, even to those acquainted
with the mysteries of magic. He is the inventor of many new
sleights and conjuring artifices.</p>

<p>Leipziger was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1873, and
was apprenticed at an early age to an optical instrument maker.
Grinding and polishing lenses is his trade, but he abandoned
it for conjuring when he came to the United States. It is a
curious fact that the majority of great magicians have been
recruited from among watchmakers, optical instrument manufacturers,
chemists, and physicians. Hundreds of them have
been doctors. Among our American Indians medicine and magic
are synonymous terms. The “medicine man” is the High Priest,
the Mage, of the tribe. As every student of psychology knows,
there is a good deal of humbug about the
practice of medicine. <span class="xxpn" id="p275">{275}</span>
Suggestion aided by deception in the way of bread pills and
harmless philtres effect as many cures as potent drugs. Surgery
is an exact science, medicine is experimental. The medico takes
naturally to magic, for he is already an adept in the art of suggestion.
Apropos of this let me quote a sentence from an article
by Joseph Jastrow (<i>Psychological Review</i>, Vol. 7, p. 617): “A
dominant principle, most frequently illustrated, is the kinship
of conjuring to suggestion; for it is the suggestion of things
not done quite as much as the concealment of those that are
done that determines the success of modern conjuring.”</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>Horace Goldin is known as the “Whirlwind Wizard,” so
called because of the rapidity of his work. His tricks and illusions
follow each other with kaleidoscopic effect. Goldin can
compress more magic feats in a twenty-minute turn, than the
average conjurer can execute in an hour. But his act is a silent
one; he uses no patter whatever. As a general rule this is to
be condemned. Amateurs are warned against it. Says Professor
Jastrow, the psychologist: “The ‘patter,’ or setting of a
trick, often constitutes the real art of its execution, because it
directs, or rather misdirects, the attention.” More than that,
artfully worded patter weaves about a conjuring experiment an
atmosphere of plausibility; people are often convinced that red
is black, etc. Consider the dramatic setting of Houdin’s magic
chest and aerial suspension. Without patter these charming
tricks would have degenerated to the commonplace. But Goldin
is a law unto himself, and must not be judged by any standards
other than those laid down by himself. He is a genius.</p>

<p>Goldin, who is of Jewish descent, was born in Wilana,
Russia, December 17, 1874. He began life as a traveling salesman.
He took to conjuring to amuse himself and his friends.
Afterwards he went on the stage. He has played before Edward
VII of England and William II of Germany. While playing an
engagement in New York City, at Hammerstein’s Theatre,
August, 1904, he went about the city in an automobile known
as the “red devil.” Some of his facetious friends described him
as a “little white devil” in a “big red
devil.” Among the <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span>
numerous clever illusions performed by him is the “Invisible Flight,”
an exposé of which was published in the <i>Strand</i>, as follows:</p>

<p>“A pedestal about seven feet high is seen in the centre of
the stage. The performer introduces a liveried assistant and
entirely envelops him in a black cloak and hood, and puts a pistol
in his right hand. He then fetches a ladder, places it against the
pedestal, walks up, and steps from it on to the top of the pedestal,
behind a curtain, which is hung in front, just reaching to his feet.
The assistant puts the ladder back and fires the pistol, when
immediately the curtain rises and a great surprise meets the
gaze of the audience, for there on the pedestal, where the performer
stepped only a moment previously, stands the liveried
servant; but the climax is reached when the supposed assistant
pulls off the cloak and hood, showing him to be none other than
the performer himself.</p>

<p>“To perform this illusion it is necessary to have two assistants
as near alike as possible and of similar stature to the performer
himself, the rest being quite simple but requiring much exactness
in execution. The performer cloaks assistant No. 1 and hands
him the pistol, then goes to fetch the ladder, part of which is
showing between the wings, the other part being held by assistant
No. 2, who is made to look, at a quick glance, exactly like the
performer. The performer catches hold of the ladder and steps
between the wings, leaving one leg showing; the assistant (No.
2) steps out backwards with the ladder, covering the performer
momentarily, who then steps right in between the wings. The
natural movement of the assistant in stepping back at the right
moment looks as if it is still the performer; indeed, he is never
suspected to be otherwise. Assistant No. 2 places the ladder
against the pedestal, walks up, and, stepping behind the curtain,
unhooks a duplicate livery from it, quickly puts it on, pockets wig
and mustache, or any other make-up which went to match the
magician’s appearance, and stands ready for the curtain to be
raised, at the sound of the pistol, by a string leading inside to one
of the stage hands. During this time assistant No. 1 has taken
the ladder back to its original place, and the performer, who
has meanwhile quickly donned a cloak and hood exactly as worn
by assistant No. 1, reverses his previous
action, stepping back <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span>
with a pistol in his right hand, this again being so natural as not
to excite suspicion. He then fires, when assistant No. 2 is seen
upon the pedestal, believed by the audience to be assistant No. 1,
the idea of a duplicate never occurring to them, as they have not
seen the change take place. The performer then takes off his
cloak and hood, bowing smilingly to the bewildered audience.”</p>

<p>One of the most entertaining men in the profession is Frederick
Eugene Powell. He is a man of scholarly attainments.
Powell was born in Philadelphia, and was attracted to magic
after having witnessed a performance by good old Signor Blitz.
He became quite an expert at the art and gave entertainments
for the amusement of his fellow students at the Pennsylvania
Military Academy, at Chester, from which institution he graduated
in 1877 with the degree of Civil Engineer and the rank
of Lieutenant. After a short career on the stage as a magician,
he entered into mercantile life. Eventually he returned to his
old love, magic, and began a series of entertainments at Wood’s
Theatre, corner of Ninth and Arch Streets, Philadelphia. His
“second-sight trick,” in which he was assisted
by his brother <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span>
Edwin, was one of his strong cards. Robert Heller had just
died, and there was no one to continue the art of second sight
but Powell. After touring the United States and Spanish
America he left the stage to take the intermediate chair of mathematics
at the Pennsylvania Military Academy, which post he
held for three years. The sedentary life affected his health, and
he returned to the stage. Powell has played several long engagements
at the Eden Musée, one of them lasting for six months.
In the year 1892, he produced at this theatre for the first time
to a New York audience the illusion “She.” In 1902 he visited
the Sandwich and Samoa Islands, and played in the principal
cities of Australia. Powell was the first conjurer to introduce
the improved “coin ladder” in this country.</p>

<p>Howard Thurston, the American illusionist, was educated
for the ministry, but abandoned theology for conjuring. He
possesses great skill with cards, and is an inventor of many novel
feats of spectacular magic.</p>

<p>His stage represents an Oriental scene. Enter Thurston
dressed somewhat after the fashion of a Tartar chieftain: loose
trousers, short jacket, turban and high boots. He introduces his
act with card manipulation, after which he produces from a shawl
thrown over his arm a bowl from which bursts a flame, then
another bowl from which spurts a jet of water like a fountain.
He stands on a small stool of glass and produces a great quantity
of water from a large tin can, by dropping into it the half of a
cocoanut shell. Enough water wells up from the can to fill
several receptacles. The thaumaturgist then defies the laws of
gravitation by suspending a large ball in the air, <i>à la</i> Mahomet’s
alleged coffin at Mecca, and passes a hoop about the ball. When
he leaves the stage, the ball follows him. This feat is accomplished
by a stream of compressed air which plays upon the
globe from a receptacle secreted in the sleeve of the performer.
The conjurer walks to a stool, covers it with a shawl, and produces
a life-size statue, which undergoes various pretty transformations.
The illusion suggests that of Professor Pepper.
Finally he produces pigeons from a borrowed hat, and toy balloons
which float in the air. Altogether it is a pleasing and
curious act. <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span></p>

<p>William G. Robinson for years acted as Alexander Herrmann’s
stage manager and machinist. He is a devotee of the
magic art, a collector of rare books on legerdemain, and the
inventor of many ingenious sleights, tricks, and illusions. When
not employed at the theatre, he spends his time haunting the
second-hand book stores, searching for literature on his favorite
hobby. He has found time to write a profoundly interesting
brochure called <i>Spirit Slate-Writing</i>, published by the Scientific
American Company. After reading this work, I cannot see how
any sane person can credit the reality of “independent slate-writing.”
It is a mere juggling trick.</p>

<div>(Mr. Wm. G. Robinson.)</div></div></div>

<p>Robinson was born in New York City, April 2, 1861, and
received a common school education. He started life as “a
worker in brass and other metals,” but he abandoned the profession
of Tubal Cain for conjuring. After the death of Herrmann,
Robinson went as assistant to Leon Herrmann for several seasons,
and then started out to astonish the natives on his own
account, but without any appreciable success. Just about this
time there came to the United States a Chinese conjurer named
Ching Ling Foo, with a repertoire of Oriental tricks. One of
them was the production of a huge bowl of water from a table-cloth,
followed by live pigeons and ducks, and last but not least
a little almond-eyed Celestial, his son. This was but a replica
of the trick which Phillippe learned from the Chinese many years
ago. Foo’s performances drew crowds to the theatres. It was
the novelty of the thing that caught the public fancy. In reality,
the Mongolian’s magic was not to be compared with that of
Herrmann, Kellar, or Goldin. Beneath the folds of a Chinese
robe one may conceal almost anything, ranging in size from a
bedpost to a cannon ball. When Foo’s manager boastfully
advertised to forfeit $500 if any American could fathom or
duplicate any of the Celestial’s tricks, “Billy” Robinson came
forward and accepted the challenge. But nothing came of it.
Foo’s impressario “backed water,” to use a boating phrase.
Robinson was so taken with Ching Ling Foo’s act that he
decided to give similar séances, disguising himself as a Chinaman.
Under the name of Chung Ling Soo he
went to England, <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span>
accompanied by his wife and a genuine Chinese acrobat. He
opened at the Empire Theatre, and not only reproduced Foo’s
best tricks but added others of his own, equally as marvelous.
His success was instantaneous. Theatrical London went wild
over the celebrated Chinese wizard, and gold began to flow into
the coffers of the Robinson ménage. So well was the secret kept
that for months no one, except the attachés of the theatre, knew
that Chung Ling Soo was a Yankee and not a genuine Chinaman.
The make-up of himself and wife
was perfect. Robinson <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span>
even had the audacity to grant interviews to newspaper reporters.
He usually held these receptions at his lodgings, where he had
an apartment fitted up <i>à la Chinois</i>; the walls hung with silken
drapery embroidered with grotesque dragons. The place was
dimly lit by Chinese lanterns. Propped up on silken cushions,
the “Yankee Celestial” with his face made up like a finely painted
mask, sipped his real oolong, and laughed in his capacious sleeves
at the credulity of the journalistic hacks. He gave his opinion
on the “Boxer” trouble, speaking a kind of gibberish which the
previously tutored Chinese acrobat pretended to interpret into
English. Gradually it leaked out in theatrical circles that Chung
Ling Soo was a Yankee, but this information never came to the
public ear generally.</p>

<p>At the close of the “Boxer” uprising the real Ching Ling Foo
had returned to his beloved Flowery Kingdom, loaded down
with bags full of dollars extracted from the pockets of the “Foreign
Devils,” yclept Americans. Under his own vine and bamboo
tree he proceeded to enjoy life like a regular Chinese
gentleman; to burn joss sticks to the memory of his ancestors,
and study the maxims of Confucius. But the longing for other
worlds to conquer with his magic overcame him, and so in the
year 1904 he went to England. Great was his astonishment to
find that a pretended Mongolian had preceded him and stolen
all of his thunder. In January, 1905, Robinson was playing at
the Hippodrome, London, and Ching Ling Foo at the Empire.
There was great rivalry between them. The result was that
Foo challenged Soo to a grand trial of strength, the articles
of which appeared in the <i>Weekly Despatch</i>. “I offer £1,000
if Chung Ling Soo, now appearing at the Hippodrome, can do
ten out of the twenty of my tricks, or if I fail to do any one of
his feats.”</p>

<p>A meeting was arranged to take place at the <i>Despatch</i> office,
on January 7, 1905, at 11 a. m. The challenged man, “Billy”
Robinson alias Chung Ling Soo, rode up to the newspaper office
in his big red automobile, accompanied by his manager and
assistants. He was dressed like a mandarin. The acrobat held
over his master’s head a gorgeous Chinese umbrella. Robinson
gave an exhibition of his skill before a
committee of newspaper <span class="xxpn" id="p283">{283}</span>
men and theatrical managers. Foo came not. The next day
arrived a letter from Ching Ling Foo’s impressario saying that
the Mongolian magician would only consent to compete against
his rival on the following condition: “That Chung Ling Soo
first prove before members of the Chinese Legation that he is a
Chinaman.” This was whipping the Devil (or shall I say
dragon?) around the stump. The original challenge had made
no condition as to the nationality of the performers.</p>

<div class="dctr03"><img src="images/i283.png"
width="480" height="703" alt="" /></div>

<p>The <i>Despatch</i> said: “The destination of the challenge money
remains in abeyance, and the questions arise: ‘Did Foo fool
Soo? And can Soo sue Foo?’&#x202f;” <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span></p>

<p>The merits of this interesting mix-up are thus summed up
by Mr. John N. Hilliard, in an editorial published in the <i>Sphinx</i>,
Kansas City, Mo., March 15, 1905:</p>

<p>“While we do not take the controversy with undue seriousness,
there is an ethical aspect in the case, however, that invites
discussion. In commenting disparagingly on the professional
ability of the Chinese conjurer, in belittling his originality and
his achievements in the magic arts, Mr. Robinson (Chung Ling
Soo) is really throwing stones at his own crystal dwelling place.
Despite the glowing presentments of his press agent, one single
naked truth shines out as clearly as a frosty star in a turquoise
sky. It is violating no confidence to assert that had it not been
for Ching Ling Foo, the professional status of Mr. William E.
Robinson, masquerading as a Chinaman, and adopting the
sobriquet of ‘Chung Ling Soo,’ would be more or less of a negative
quantity to-day. Ching Ling Foo, the genuine Chinaman,
is indisputably the originator, so far as the Western hemisphere
is concerned, at least, of this peculiar act, and Robinson
is merely an imitator. Robinson is shrewd and has a ‘head for
business.’ He doubtless realizes, as well as his critics, that in
the dress of the modern magician he would not be unqualifiedly
successful, despite his skill with cards and coins and his knowledge
of the art. The success of Ching Ling Foo in this country
was his opportunity. Adopting the dress and make-up of a
Mongolian, and appropriating the leading features of Ching’s
act, he went to Europe, where the act was a novelty, and scored
a great success. Of course, from a utilitarian point of view,
this success is legitimate; but in the light of what the American
magician really owes to the great Chinese conjurer, it is ridiculous
for Robinson to pose as ‘the original Chinese magician,’
and for him to say that Ching Ling Foo is ‘a performer of the
streets,’ while he is the ‘court magician to the Empress Dowager.’
This may be good showmanship, but it is not fair play. The
devil himself is entitled to his due; and, the question of merit
aside, the indubitable fact remains that it is Ching Ling Foo
who is the ‘original Chinese magician,’ while ‘Chung Ling Soo’
is an imitator of his act and a usurper in
the Oriental kingdom. <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
But outside of the ethical nature of the controversy, we refuse to
take it seriously.”</p>

<p>Robinson calls himself “Chung Ling Soo, he of the One
Button [mandarin], Royal Chinese Conjurer.” Chung Ling
Soo, in the vernacular of Confucius, means Double Luck, or
extra good luck. Wherever he goes he puts on exhibition in the
lobby of the theatre the resplendent robes of his ancestors—“a
piece of sacrilege,” says an English paper, “no Chinaman the
world has ever known has been guilty of before. Some of the
exhibits are from the Imperial palace at Pekin.” These gorgeous
garments were doubtless purchased in some Chinese bazaar in
London. According to a Holloway journal, Robinson is the
possessor of a wonderful collection of Oriental embroideries,
carvings, armor, and swords, and last but not
least, “a splendid <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
palanquin which cost the Chinese equivalent of 1,000 guineas.
It was presented to him by the late Dowager Empress of China,
and is constructed of solid ebony inlaid with gold and precious
stones.” In this palanquin, Robinson comes on the stage to
perform his bullet-catching feat, supposed to be a replica of a
similar adventure when he was attacked by “Boxers” in China.
This is Herrmann’s old trick, with an Oriental setting. Some
years ago, a German-American wizard, Prof. Mingus, invented
a method of catching live gold fish on the end of a line fixed to
an ordinary bamboo fishing rod. The line being cast in the air,
a gold fish appeared dangling upon the hook. The fish was then
thrown into a bowl of water and shown to the audience. Several
fish were caught in this manner. Robinson adopted this trick
with great success. Pestered to death for an explanation of the
mystery by his journalistic friends, he finally condescended to
explain (?) it. He thus described it in the <i>News of the World</i>,
Holloway, England, April 9, 1905:</p>

<p>“Anyone may know how Chung does the goldfish trick, but
it does not follow that having been told one can do it. When
Chung Ling Soo makes casts in the air with his rod and line,
little Suce Seen, the Celestial handmaiden, stands meekly some
yards away, holding a glass bowl of water. The hook is a
powerful magnet, and if one could examine the goldfish caught,
one would detect pieces of metal attached to the bodies of the
finny captures. The live goldfish repose in little Suce Seen’s
sleeve, and when a more than usually skillful cast brings the
magnetic bait for a second into the interior of the girl’s sleeve,
a ‘catch’ has at once been effected, and the fish is seen dangling
and wriggling in the air at the end of the line.”</p>

<p>It is needless to remark that this is a <i>fish story</i>. Chung Ling
Soo is romancing. The gold fish are concealed in the handle of
the rod. The fish that appears on the hook at each cast of the line
is an imitation affair of silk, which is hidden in the hollow lead
sinker. A substitution is made, and the real fish thrown into the
bowl by the conjurer. The dainty little Chinese maiden (Mrs.
Robinson) has nothing more to do with the trick than the people
in the audience. She merely holds the bowl and looks cute.</p>

<p>The following is a sample of some of
the nonsense published <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span>
about Robinson, taken from the <i>Weekly Despatch</i>, April 9, 1905:</p>

<p>“Chung Ling Soo rose from the ranks, and his fame as a
sorcerer penetrated to the Chinese Empress Dowager, who
commanded him to court, where, after years of service, he was
promoted to many Celestial honors, and ultimately the rank
of Mandarin was bestowed upon him. His skin is yellow, his
eyes are black and oblique, and his teeth are absolutely inky, as
all true Celestials of rank should be.” Any one acquainted with
the art of stage “make-up” knows how easily these facial
effects can be produced. There is even a black paste for the
teeth. I don’t doubt this much of the journalist’s story—but the
“Celestial honors” and the “rank of Mandarin”—shade of the
illustrious Münchausen preserve us! Poor old Ching Ling Foo,
the original Chinaman, has doubtless devoted his ingenious rival
and “foreign devil” to the innumerable hells of the Chinese
Buddhists.</p>

<p>So much for the Oriental ancestry of my old friend, Billy
Robinson, the “One Button Man” of the Celestial Empire (Theatre
of London, England).</p>

<p>Robinson is the inventor of the clever stage illusion “Gone,”
which Herrmann exhibited, and which still forms one of the
principal specialties of Kellar. I am indebted to my friend,
Henry V. A. Parsell, for an accurate description of the trick,
as at present worked by Mr. Kellar.</p>

<p>“At the rise of the curtain the stage is seen to have its rear
part concealed by a second curtain and drapery, which, being
drawn up, discloses a substantial framework. This framework,
at the first glance, gives one the impression that it is that horrible
instrument of death, the guillotine. As will be seen, it consists
simply of two uprights, with a bar across the top and another
a little below the middle. Just below the centre bar is a windlass,
the two ropes of which pass through two pulleys fixed to the top
bar. The machine stands out boldly against a black background,
the distance from which is indeterminate.</p>

<p>“After the introduction of the fair maiden ‘who is to be gone,’
an ordinary looking bent wood chair is shown. The chair is
then placed on the stage behind the framework, and by means
of snap hooks the two ropes from the
windlass are attached <span class="xxpn" id="p288">{288}</span>
to the side of the chair. The maiden is now seated in the chair
and her skirt adjusted that it may not hang too low.</p>

<span class="smcap">“G<b>ONE,”</b></span>
<span class="smcap">R<b>OBINSON’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>LLUSION.</b></span></div></div>

<p>“A couple of assistants now work the windlass and elevate
the chair and its occupant until they are well above the middle
cross bar. One assistant then retires, the other remains with one
hand resting against the side of the framework. The performer
fires his pistol thrice, upon which the maiden
vanishes and the <span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span>
fragments of the chair fall to the ground. The illusion is produced
by a black curtain which lies concealed behind the middle
cross bar. When the pistol is fired, the assistant, whose hand
is on the frame, presses a spring which releases this black curtain
which is instantly drawn up in front of the suspended girl. At
this same moment the girl undoes a couple of catches which
allow the main part of the chair to drop. She, meanwhile, being
seated on a false chair-bottom to which the ropes are attached.”</p>

<p>As originally devised by Mr. Robinson, the illusion was
based upon the Pepper ghost-show. Between the cross-bars of
a slanting frame was a sheet of plate glass which, being invisible,
left the lady on the chair in full view as long as the light fell
upon her. A screen of the same color as the background was
concealed above the curtain and placed at such an angle as to
allow its reflection to pass out to the audience. The firing of the
pistol was the signal for the assistant to turn a switch. The lady
was then veiled in relative darkness while the screen was illuminated
and its reflection on the plate glass concealed her from
sight. Carrying around the country a big sheet of plate glass
is not only an expensive luxury but a risky one, so the illusion
was simplified in the manner described by Mr. Parsell.</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">VI.</h3>

<p>Buatier de Kolta was the greatest inventor of magic tricks
and illusions since the days of Robert-Houdin. He was an absolutely
original genius, who set at defiance Solomon’s adage.
“There is nothing new under the sun,” by producing in rapid
succession a series of brilliant feats that astounded the world
of magic. I am indebted to my friend, Dr. W. Golden Mortimer,
for facts concerning the career of de Kolta.</p>

<p>Joseph Buatier de Kolta was born in Lyons, France, in the
year 1845. For centuries his father’s people had inhabited the
ancient palace of the Emperor Claudius. Each firstborn male
of the Buatier family was given the Roman name. The subject
of our sketch had a sister and two brothers, the latter, with himself,
being set apart for the priesthood. His brother Claudius
was not given to churchly ways, but the second brother actually
entered upon the holy orders. Joseph was at
college when he <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
first saw the wonders of magic as revealed by a strolling
magician, and he became so fascinated with the possibilities of
the art that he entered upon it at once.</p>

<div class="dctr04"><img src="images/i290.jpg"

<span class="smcap">B<b>UATIER</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">DE</span>
<span class="smcap">K<b>OLTA</b></span></div></div>

<p>He commenced his professional career at Geneva, Italy, in
1867, and shortly after became associated with his cousin, Julias
Vidos de Kolta, who for fifteen years thereafter acted as his
business manager. De Kolta was his mother’s maiden name,
adopted by her ancestors from one of the Hungarian provinces.
Buatier de Kolta, as the magician was now known, traveled
through Italy, where he presented a two hours’ entertainment,
consisting of original sleights with a multiplicity of small properties.
In 1875 he opened in London, where a great furore was
made with his flying cage, which he had introduced in Italy
some two years earlier. Though de Kolta was
not given to <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span>
mishaps, on the first presentation of his trick he threw the cage
out into the audience, an accident which has been repeated by
other performers.</p>

<span class="smcap">F<b>LYING</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>AGE.</b></span></div></div>

<p>He married Miss Alice Allen, in London, December 8, 1887.
She afterwards traveled with him as his assistant, and acted as
his business manager. In the year 1891, he made his first appearance
in the United States by playing a four months’ engagement
at the Eden Musée, New York City. On that occasion
he introduced the large vanishing cage, which he intended as a
satire on the flying cage because of the repeated supposition that
a bird was killed at each performance of that trick, but he never
liked the large cage and soon abandoned it. In 1903 he returned
to this country, and opened at the Eden Musée, on September
15, where he played many months. Among other
new tricks he <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span>
exhibited an improvement on the “rising cards,” consisting in
the continuous and successive rising of every card in a pack from
out a glass tumbler; and a little sketch entitled “<i>la danse des
millions</i>,” in which the money-catching idea was elaborated.
This number, delivered in Alexandrine verses with all the charm
of a classic, was intended as a hit at the extravagance of the
Panama Canal Company under the régime of De Lesseps and his
associates.</p>

<p>On that occasion he introduced an absolutely new illusion,
the effect of which was as follows: The curtain rose showing
a platform in the center of the stage. It was about four feet
square and eighteen inches high, with four legs. The conjurer
appeared carrying a satchel in one hand. He informed the audience
that he kept his wife in the receptacle. It was a convenient
way of transporting her about with him. Opening the satchel,
he took therefrom a die about six inches square, remarking that
his consort was concealed within it. This he placed on the platform.
After arranging two open fans on the back of the platform
he touched a spring, whereupon the die opened to about two
and a half feet square. Presto!—he lifted up the die and his wife
appeared on the platform, sitting cross-legged like a Turkish
lady on a divan.</p>

<p>The secret of this surprising illusion died with Buatier de
Kolta. His wife refused to reveal it after his death.</p>

<p>From New York de Kolta went to New Orleans to play an
engagement at the Orpheum Theatre. In that city he died of
acute Bright’s disease on October 7, 1903. The body was taken
to London for burial.</p>

<p>Among the better known tricks and illusions invented by de
Kolta may be mentioned the following: The flying bird cage
(1873); the vanishing lady (1889); flowers from a paper cone
(1886); the cocoon and living pictures (1887); and his disappearance,
at the top of a twenty-one-foot ladder set upright
against a bridge, in full light; soup plate and handkerchiefs; the
decanters and flying handkerchiefs; multiplying billiard balls;
production of a large flag on a staff; new ink and water trick,
etc. <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span></p>

<p>In conjunction with J. Nevil Maskelyne, he invented the
“Black Art, or the Mahatmas Outdone.” It has been exposed by
the <i>Strand</i>, February, 1903, as follows:</p>

<p>“It is necessary for the benefit of those who have never seen
an act of this kind to explain that everything is performed in
a dark chamber—either the whole stage or a chamber fitted up
in the center of it—draped entirely in black—sides, back, floor,
and ceiling. The hall is placed almost in darkness, the only lights
being a set of sidelights and footlights, which are turned toward
the audience with reflectors behind, making it impossible for
eyes to penetrate into the darkness beyond them. Everything
used in the chamber is white, even the performer’s dress, forming
a contrast necessary to the illusion.</p>

<p>“The séance is usually commenced by the production of tables
and goblets from space. In fact, everything required is mysteriously
obtained from apparent nothingness. The performer,
usually dressed in an Eastern costume, all of white, enters the
empty chamber, and, requiring a wand, raises his hand, when
one comes floating into it. He next taps the floor at the left
side of the chamber and a small table suddenly appears. This he
repeats at the right side, with the same result. He now taps
one of the tables and a large goblet appears upon it in the same
mysterious manner. This also he repeats at the other table,
having now two tables several yards apart, with a goblet upon
each. The whole are brought forward for inspection and
replaced within the chamber. The performer takes one of the
goblets, raises it, turns it over and around in several ways, and
it is seen that the other is going through exactly the same movements
without anyone being near it. The performer replaces
his goblet upon the table; but the other remains suspended alone
in mid-air, and the performer places a large ring over it and
around it, showing wires or any other connection to be absent.
He brings it forward and again hands it for examination, but on
regaining it does not take it to the table, for by a wave of his
hand the table comes dancing out to him and on receiving the
goblet dances back to its original position. He next proceeds
to borrow several watches and other articles of jewelry, which
he takes into the chamber and places in the
goblet on the <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span>
right. They are clearly seen to drop from his hand from several
inches above; he shows his hands empty and immediately rushes
across to the other goblet, brings it forward, and allows the
audience themselves to take out all the jewelry which was placed
in the right goblet only a moment previous. Having finished
with these articles, they disappear as mysteriously and quickly
as they appeared.</p>

<p>“The next illusion performed is the production from space
of a live lady’s bust suspended in a frame. The performer raises
his wand and a large picture-frame suddenly hangs itself upon
it. This is brought for examination, then placed in the center of
the chamber, where it remains suspended in mid-air and sets up
a swinging motion by itself. It is then covered momentarily
with an Eastern rug, and when removed, a lady, devoid of legs,
whose body completely fills the frame, is seen swinging with it.
The ‘live picture’ is covered momentarily, and when the covering
is withdrawn a large Union Jack is seen to have taken the place
of the lady, who has vanished.</p>

<div class="dctr01"><img src="images/i294.jpg"

<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>TS</b></span>
<span class="smcap">M<b>YSTERIES.</b></span></div></div>

<p>“The performer proceeds next with a decapitation act, in
which a lady is beheaded in full view of the audience. At a wave
of his hand a lady appears, and hands to him her own gruesome
means of execution, a large, glittering sabre,
which he takes, <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span>
and with one swing cuts her head clean off where she stands.
Catching the head as it falls, he places a pair of wings at the back
of it, when it becomes a flying cherub, and immediately soars
all about the chamber, finally returning to his outstretched hand.
He then removes the wings and replaces the head upon the lady’s
shoulders, restoring her to life, for which kindness she quickly
embraces him and vanishes. Wishing to get another such share
of her favors, the performer endeavors to bring her back by
magic aid, but is surprised by the appearance of a grinning
ghost, whose whole body consists of a skull, with a moving jaw,
draped with a white sheet. He catches it, and detaching its
skull brings it forward for a closer scrutiny, the jaw moving all
the time and the sheet dancing about alone. He then throws
the skull into the air and it is seen no more.</p>

</div></div>

<p>“The séance is generally concluded by an invisible flight,
the vanishing performer immediately reappearing amongst the
audience. He takes the dancing sheet and entirely covers himself
with it, standing in the center of the chamber, taking great care
to drape himself in such a manner as to show the shape of his
body. In a few seconds the sheet collapses, and before it has
time to reach the ground a shout is heard in the
back of the <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span>
hall; the audience turning around naturally are surprised to see
the performer standing amongst them, smilingly bowing in
acknowledgment of the applause which greets him.</p>

<p>“As before mentioned, the whole of this takes place in darkness,
obtained by the chamber being draped in black velvet and
the floor covered with black felt. The brightness of the lights
turned towards the audience, contrasting with the denseness of
the black behind, dazzles the eye to such an extent that it cannot
discern anything in the chamber that is not white or of a
very light color. The stage is all arranged before the act, and
the tables are in their respective places, but cannot be seen on
account of their being draped with black velvet. The goblets,
frame, lady, ghost, etc., are all placed in readiness behind a black
screen, also draped. None of this can be seen while they are
behind the lights, if kept covered in black, no matter how near
to the front they are placed. But how do they float about and
appear so mysteriously? An assistant is within the chamber,
dressed in black velvet throughout, with black gloves and
mask, covering all signs of white about him and making
him perfectly invisible. He wears no boots,
and the felt <span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span>
upon the floor deadens the sound of all his movements. He
it is who really produces all the articles. When the performer
stretches his hand out for the wand, the assistant brings it from
behind the screen and hands it to him with a floating movement.
As the performer taps the floor he immediately pulls away the
black covering and the table instantly appears to view. The
goblets are painted black inside, allowing him to hold them at
the back with his fingers inside, unnoticed. After the tables are
both produced he places the goblets upon them at the right
moment with one hand while he pulls off the velvet with the
other. The exposition is so quick and sudden that nothing suspicious
can be noticed. The turning of the goblet is also the
work of the invisible assistant, and is quickly changed from one
hand to another when the ring is being passed over it. The
watches, etc., are not placed in the goblet as they appear to be,
but dropped behind it into the assistant’s hands, who takes them
over to the other while the performer is exhibiting his empty
hands. The picture-frame is also handed by the assistant, and
when it is apparently placed in mid-air is really passed to the
assistant, who quickly hangs it up. When it is covered the lady
steps from behind the screen to the frame, and stands upon a
swing which nearly reaches to the floor behind it, and catches
hold of the frame sides; the assistant draws away the velvet
which draped her, and keeps the swing in motion. The frame
is attached to the wires of this swing. The lady is dressed in
white to the waist, which exactly reaches the bottom of the
frame. Below the frame she is dressed in black velvet. When
the frame is again covered she steps back behind the screen
while the assistant fits the Union Jack in the frame. In the
decapitation act there are two ladies, one dressed all in white,
the other standing behind her dressed in black, with her head
covered by a black hood. When the performer swings the
sabre the assistant covers the white lady’s head with a black
velvet hood, at the same time pulling the hood quickly from the
other lady’s head, who immediately falls to her knees. The
illusion looks perfect—a body apparently standing without a
head and the head apparently falling. When the wings are put
on she flaps them by means of a wire and
runs round the <span class="xxpn" id="p298">{298}</span>
chamber, stooping at intervals, so as to take an irregular course. The
beheaded lady is restored by exactly the reverse method, and she
disappears behind the screen. The ghost is danced about on a
stick by the assistant, and when its skull is thrown into the air
it is caught in a black bag. The performer takes the sheet and
goes behind it and hands it to the assistant, and it is the latter
who is seen draping himself, the performer
running around to <span class="xxpn" id="p299">{299}</span>
the back of the hall meanwhile, where he waits to see the sheet
drop. The assistant, allowing time for this, simply lets go the
top of the sheet, and, of course, cannot be seen behind it. The
performer runs in before it has time to reach the ground, his
invisible flight and immediate reappearance greatly astonishing
the spectators.”</p>

<p>Cazeneuve, better known as <i>le commandeur</i> Cazeneuve, the
great card expert and magician, was born in Toulouse in 1840.
He adopted magic, after witnessing a performance of that original
genius, Bosco. His chivalric title (commander of the
imperial order of Medjidie) was conferred upon him by the
Sultan of Turkey, with whom he was a favorite. At the Court
of Russia he and his charming wife made a great sensation
with the second-sight trick. When the Franco-Prussian war
broke out, Cazeneuve returned to Toulouse and raised two
companies of soldiers, one of which was composed entirely of
theatrical people. He served as captain of the 1st regiment of
Tirailleurs d’Elite, under the command of Colonel Riu, and
fought bravely for France. After peace was declared he prepared
a new programme of magic and toured Europe and the
Americas. He has a handsome home in his native city of Toulouse,
where he has collected many rare curios. In the year
1905, Cazeneuve was touring Algeria with a magic show. He
is a member of several scientific societies, and manifests great
interest in physics.</p>

<p>I first saw Carl Hertz in Baltimore at the old vaudeville
theatre “across the bridge,” some twenty years ago. I remember
him as a clever, good-looking young fellow, possessed of considerable
dash, and very neat in the performance of card tricks.
His specialty was the “bird-cage trick,” which he did to perfection.
He was born in San Francisco, of German parents.
His first manager was M. de Frère. Hertz has traveled extensively
in the Orient. With the bird-cage trick he puzzled the
best informed fakirs of India. In Borneo he met with a most
romantic adventure. He is probably the only man who has had
to offer himself as a burnt-offering to escape an amorous Princess.
He was giving a series of magical entertainments before a Malay
Sultan and Court, and not only succeeded in fascinating the
yellow-skinned monarch, but his daughter as well. The young
princess proposed marriage to the conjurer. “On Mr. Hertz
informing the lady, through an interpreter, that he was already
wedded, she replied that made no difference to her, as she would
rule his other ladies. Here was a fix.
However, with the <span class="xxpn" id="p301">{301}</span>
connivance of the British Vice-Consul, Mr. Hertz took the place
of his lawful spouse in the Phœnix illusion, and jumping into
the blazing caldron waved an affectionate adieu to the astonished
and dismayed Princess. Mrs. Hertz had to keep up the
delusion by weeping copiously while her husband was being
conveyed to the coast in a basket.”</p>

<p>In the Sandwich Islands, on one occasion, a chief leaped
upon the stage where Hertz was performing and began worshiping
him as a god. How very real must have been the effect
of Hertz’s magic upon the untutored mind of that simple native.</p>

<p>In the year 1904, a troupe of Hindoo jugglers, acrobats and
snake charmers were brought to the United States to entertain
lovers of the marvelous at the St. Louis Exposition. Among
them was a man with an unpronounceable name, whom the
management dubbed “Alexander.” I met the dusky necromancer
at Martinka’s in the summer of 1904. He went about
the streets of New York garbed in his rich Oriental costume.
The street gamins always followed him from his hotel to the
Palace of Magic and stood about the doorway in crowds, awaiting
in breathless astonishment some feat of wizardry. But the
impassive Hindoo paid no attention to his youthful admirers,
but went on blowing wreaths of smoke from Egyptian cigarettes,
and making purchases of magical apparatus with which
to astonish the natives of his beloved India. Taking magic
tricks to India is like carrying coals to Newcastle. But Alexander
had a very high opinion of Occidental conjuring, and
fully realized the fact that the sorcerers of the West, aided
by all the resources of modern science, were the superiors of
the Hindoo fakirs, except perhaps in one particular—feats of
hypnotism and apparent death. I saw Alexander, in Martinka s
little back shop, support a couple of heavy iron weights, which
were fastened at the ends of a cord, upon his eyelids. The
cord rested on the lids, the weights dangling at the ends of
the string. The pressure upon the eyeballs must have been
tremendous. Alexander presented Dr. Ellison with a wand—the
thigh-bone of a sacred simian from the famous monkey
temple of India. The bone was inscribed with cabalistic characters
and Sanskrit sentences. The monkey is
famous for playing <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span>
tricks, and the thigh-bone of a sacred monkey consequently
ought to make an admirable mystic wand for a conjurer. The
doctor prizes this unique relic very highly, and is thinking of
building a shrine of Benares copper for its reception. In the
future, crowds of wandering wizards will doubtless make pilgrimages
to this shrine to gaze in ecstasy at the holy relic, just
as crowds of East Indians visit the temple where Buddha’s
wisdom tooth is displayed for the delectation of the faithful.</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">VIII.</h3>

<p>In the year 1894 there flashed on the theatrical horizon of
Europe an eccentric gentleman conjurer, who performed with
a mask on his face, advertising himself as <i>L’Homme Masqué</i>
(the Masked Man).</p>

<p>“Who is he?” inquired the <i>quid nuncs</i> of the vaudeville
theatres.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to know. Had the Man in the Iron Mask,
celebrated by Voltaire and Alexander Dumas, come to life again?</p>

<p>“What does he wear a mask for?” asked the public.</p>

<p>“To hide his aristocratic features,” replied the manager of
<i>L’Homme Masqué</i>. “He wishes to remain incognito.”</p>

<p>Eventually he permitted his name to leak out. It was Marquis
d’O. “But ‘O’ is not a name,” cried the <i>quid nuncs</i>. “It
is a letter, an exclamation of surprise or terror.” “Not so fast,”
remarked the Dryasdusts. “There was a Marquis d’O who
lived in the seventeenth century. He was a noted duelist and
gambler, but that did not prevent him from being a favorite
with Henri III of France. Possibly <i>L’Homme Masqué</i> is a
descendant of the famous nobleman of the old régime. He is
unquestionably a Frenchman, for he speaks like a native.”</p>

<p>The masked man refused to further reveal his identity. In
one respect he resembled the favorite of the Valois King. He
was familiar with cards. After losing 800,000 francs at Monte
Carlo, he took up magic as a profession and made his début,
March, 1894. I have ascertained that the Marquis is a native
of Peru, South America. His real name I do not know. The
“O” perhaps is a <i>nom de thèatre</i>. Again, it
may be an <span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span>
abbreviation of Olivarez. Mr. Downs writes as follows in the Sphinx,
January, 1903, concerning the mysterious marquis:</p>

<p>“<i>L Homme’ Masqué</i> (Marquis d’O) and myself are especially
engaged to give a series of magical performances at the Casino
Theatre, Spa, Belgium, Nov. 15 to Dec. 31, 1902. The Marquis
is a remarkably clever magician of the non-apparatus school
and gives an hour and thirty minutes’ performance, changing
his show each evening. He uses only cards, handkerchiefs,
flowers, eggs and other small objects for his illusions. He is
eminently original and possesses a great personality. He is
a decided sensation in the theatrical world. His success has
been so pronounced that he has had many imitators who have
donned the mask and traded on his reputation. The Society
of Magicians in Hamburg presented him with a valuable gold-tipped
wand set with diamonds. Like Robert-Houdin, the Marquis
presents his audiences with many charming souvenirs, some
of them of considerable value, such as cigarette cases, cigars,
bouquets, etc. He is very popular in aristocratic circles. When
in London, he received as high as £20 for a private entertainment
and was invited everywhere.”</p>

<p>To keep the public guessing is the particular business of a
conjurer, but to keep people guessing as to your identity as
well as your tricks, caps the climax in the art of mystery mongering.
Imagine the Sphinx wearing a mask. This business
of a wizard disguising his features with a black mask is a piece
of sublime audacity. <i>Vive le</i> Marquis d’O! Is it not a pity that
such an act cannot be copyrighted? Think of some really original
idea and produce it on the stage and immediately hundreds
of imitators will spring up like mushrooms in a single night.
Not only will they copy your act, but your patter as well.</p>

<p>Two of our foremost American conjurers, Downs and
Houdini, can testify to this fact. T. Nelson Downs, the “King
of Coins,” a native of Marshaltown, Iowa, invented a number
of original sleights with coins, which he embodied in an act
known as the Miser’s Dream. A brilliant success was the result,
whereupon a legion of imitators, billing themselves as Coin
Kings, sprang up everywhere. Downs, however, remains the
unapproachable manipulator of coins; his
imitators have gone <span class="xxpn" id="p304">{304}</span>
to the wall, one after the other. Downs’ act is really unique,
He is also a fine performer with cards. Edward VII of England,
who has a penchant for entertainments of magic and mystery,
had Downs give private séances for him, and was charmed
with the American’s skill.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">IX.</h3>

<p>A word or two here concerning that brilliant entertainer,
Harry Houdini, whose handcuff act is the sensation of two
continents.</p>

<p>Mr. Houdini, whose real name is Weiss, was born April 6,
1873, in Appleton, Wisconsin. He began his career as an
entertainer when but nine years of age, doing a contortion and
trapeze act in Jack Hoffler’s “five cent” circus in Appleton.
His mother took him away from the sawdust arena and apprenticed
him to a locksmith. Here he was initiated into the mysteries
of locks and keys, and laid the foundation of his great
handcuff act. Locksmithing, despite the fact that King Louis
XVI of France worked at it as an amateur, possessed no charms
for the youthful Houdini. To use his own expression, “One
day I made a bolt for the door, and never came back to my
employer.” Again he went with a circus, where he acted as
a conjurer, a clown and a ventriloquist. He made a specialty
of the rope-tying business and performed occasionally with
handcuffs, but without sensational results. Finally the circus
landed in Rhode Island and opened up in a town where Sunday
performances were forbidden by law, but were greatly desired
by a large section of the population. As the fine was light, the
proprietor ran the risk, and gave a show on the Sabbath. A
summons followed, and each member of the troupe was fined.
As Houdini epigrammatically put it: “The manager couldn’t
find the fine, so we all found ourselves in confinement.” Houdini
was locked up in a cell with a number of side-show freaks, the
fat lady, the living skeleton, and the German giant. The fat
lady was too wide for the compartment, the giant too long.
With tears in their eyes they emplored Houdini to pick the lock
and let them out. Finally the young conjurer consented, and
dexterously picked the lock, whereupon he
and his companions <span class="xxpn" id="p305">{305}</span>
marched out of the jail in triumph, and paraded down the main
street of the town in Indian file, to the great amusement of the
populace. Houdini was rearrested on the charge of jail-breaking,
but the judge let him off with a reprimand. This event
decided his career. He became a “Handcuff King.”</p>

<p>His salary at the Alhambra Theatre, London, was $300 a
week. One week at St. Petersburg, Russia, netted him over
$2,000. He appeared before royalty. <span class="xxpn"

<p>The handcuff act when exhibited with the proper <i>mise en
scène</i> is certainly very mystifying and calculated to produce
a profound impression on the minds of susceptible people. Taking
the cue from the Davenport Brothers, Houdini might have
advertised himself as a spirit medium, thereby creating a great
sensation. But he preferred not to play the charlatan. I am
not personally acquainted with his method of working the trick,
therefore I express no opinion on the subject, except to say
that the locks of the handcuffs are <i>picked</i> with a
key of some <span class="xxpn" id="p307">{307}</span>
kind which is adroitly secreted about the person of the performer;
or some soft piece of iron or copper wire which can be
converted into a skeleton key. In the event of his being stripped
naked (as often occurs in the case of Houdini) the key is probably
hidden in the nose, ear, mouth, or bushy hair of the Handcuff
King—or else slipped to him by a confederate, or concealed
in a pocket in the drapery of the cabinet. I quote the following
from the <i>Strand Magazine</i> (Sept., 1903):</p>

<p>“For a man fettered with handcuffs, leg-irons, and chains
to free himself in less time than it has taken to fasten him has
long been so mystifying a performance that many people have
acquired the impression that it bordered on the supernatural.
The secret is, however, like many of the best tricks ever invented,
in reality a surprisingly simple one.</p>

<p>“In the first place, it must be remembered that handcuffs
such as are used by Scotland Yard are constructed with spring-locks,
which are fastened or released by means of a key, or
some article which answers the same purpose, which pulls back
the spring. Without the aid of such a key it is impossible for
any human being to free himself from the regulation handcuffs
employed by the police. And herein lies
the whole <span class="xxpn" id="p308">{308}</span>
secret—the performer <i>has</i> a key, or rather several keys. All his ingenuity
is exercised in concealing these about his person, or inside
the cabinet to which he retires to release himself after being, to
all appearances, helplessly secured.</p>

<p>“Some of these keys are concealed in the framework of the
cabinet, which is generally constructed of piping, having additional
pieces which appear to be essential portions of the framework,
but which in reality are only intended to hold the keys.
Other keys the performer keeps disposed about his person in
sundry small pockets especially made for the purpose, and so
arranged that he is able to place his hand upon some one or other
of them in whatever position he may be. The best places for
concealment are—first, a pocket between the knees, to permit
the key to be reached when the performer is fastened in a
crouched position; secondly, a pocket about six inches up inside
the leg of the trousers; thirdly, a key carried in the hip pocket
of the trousers, for use when pinioned with the arms behind
the back; and finally, a small pocket inside the top of the waistcoat,
or wherever it may be found convenient.</p>

<p>“Let us now turn to the photographs, which have been
especially taken for this article, and which render the whole
proceeding very clear. In Fig. 1 the performer is fastened with
six pairs of handcuffs. In such a position it seems impossible
that he can free himself; but by putting his hands over his head
and down his coat collar he has caught the end of a silk handkerchief
thrust into the breast of his waistcoat, to which a key
is attached. Fig. 2 shows the handkerchief and key drawn to
the front; while Fig. 3 shows the key inserted in the lock.</p>

<p>“Fig. 4 shows the method employed when the position is
such that it is impossible, owing to the awkwardness of the attitude,
to pull the lock back. A piece of violin string is made
into a loop and kept inside the cabinet. When it is impossible
to draw the key, and with it the lock spring, with the
fingers, the loop is put over the key, the heel of
the boot placed <span class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span>
in the other end of the loop, and the lock is then easily drawn
back. After one pair has been opened the others follow as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>“Figs. 5 and 6 show another position, the key this time being
obtained from the waistcoat. Fig. 7 shows one of the most difficult
positions in which it is possible to be placed. The silk
handkerchief shown is just peeping from the waistcoat, and is
brought out by the aid of the tongue, it being possible to draw
out a good silk by licking it. In Fig. 8 the performer has rolled
over and obtained a good hold of the handkerchief, which, by
a quick jerk of the head, he throws over his back, and eventually
gets hold of it with his hands, as shown in Fig. 9. If the key
falls to the floor he rolls over and picks it up, the rattle of the
handcuffs hiding the sound of the falling key. His next movement
is to free his hands from his feet, which he does in the
manner already described. The key for this position can also
be obtained from the leg of the trousers.</p>

<p>“Fig. 10 shows the implements of torture and the condition
of the performer’s wrists after an exhibition.
The special keys
<span class="xxpn" id="p312">{312}</span>
are split with a saw about half an inch down, to allow for
variation in the sizes of various locks (Fig. 11). It should be
understood that an expert, when about to give a performance,
inquires what position it is intended to place him in. He then
causes, as an introduction, a few pairs of his own handcuffs to
be placed on his wrists, and while freeing himself from these
in his cabinet he arranges his keys to suit the position in which
he will next be placed. Other implements besides keys are
also used: a piece of bent wire is often quite sufficient. Most
experts are also conjurers, and ‘palm’ the key, especially in the
case of a nude test, when they are stripped and locked up in
a cell; or they make use of a concealing key, which is made telescopic,
the handle being constructed to close down
the side of <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span>
the key, and the whole being fixed under the toes by a piece of
shoemaker’s wax and detached when inside the cell.</p>

<p>“Although, when the secret is explained, it seems very easy
to accomplish, it must be understood that it is necessary for
a successful performer to possess very hard, strong wrists and
abundance of finger strength, and to be a man of some resource.
It is almost impossible for any person to fasten an expert
securely unless he himself understands the secret of the method
of escape, and even then he may not be successful. On one
occasion a performer underwent a severe test by a person who
understood the secret, and therefore did not use any keys whatever,
but by a very ingenious method overcame the efforts of
the gentleman in question to fasten him. He obtained some
very small gold-filled wire and made it into the form of a wire
ring, which was partly covered by a broad gold one, to which
the wire ring was attached. Thus prepared he underwent the
test, unwrapping the wire ring when in the cabinet. Needless
to state, in a very short time he was free.</p>

<p>“Handcuffs are sometimes brought to fetter the performer
with the locks plugged or otherwise tampered with. But it is
the performer’s own fault if he is trapped. It is a very easy
matter to tamper with the locks—a few
lead pellets dropped <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
down the barrel will effectually prevent the lock from being
drawn. This method has often been attempted, but not successfully.</p>

<p>“Now that the methods have been explained and illustrated,
it will be very easily perceived that there is nothing supernatural
about the secret of handcuff manipulation.”</p>

<p>Houdini is not only a Handcuff King, but a skillful performer
with cards. When too many imitators shall have made
his specialty a drug on the market, he can take to some other
branch of conjuring. He has a very fine trunk illusion which
he often combines with his handcuff act. For seven years past
he has been collecting data for an extensive biographical encyclopedia
of magicians. In his travels on the continent of Europe
he has visited the homes and haunts of famous conjurers of
the past and secured valuable material for his prospective book.
Thanks to this interesting man, photographs of the tombs of
Robert-Houdin and Bosco have been made, and considerable
light thrown on their careers. In a letter to me, October 9,
1905, he says: “When in Russia, I searched in vain for the
grave of the fascinating Pinetti—that pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur <i>par excellence</i>
of the eighteenth century—but, alas, my labors were not
rewarded. But in St. Petersburg I picked up an exceedingly
rare portrait of Pinetti, which I prize highly and which will
form the frontispiece to my book on magicians.” Houdini is
a reincarnation of Sir Walter Scott’s Old Mortality, who went
about furbishing up the tombstones of the illustrious dead of
his faith. When at home (New York City), Harry Houdini
lives among his books and curios. He has also a handsome farm
in Massachusetts. Houdini’s brother, under the stage name of
Hardeen, is also a handcuff expert.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">X.</h3>

<p>In this review of magicians I have met, I must not fail to
mention Charles Edwin Fields of the Royal Aquarium and
Crystal Palace, London, England. This veteran of the wand
was born in London, May 15, 1835, and received a good education
at private academies in England and France. He has
appeared before royalty and instructed hundreds
of people in <span class="xxpn" id="p315">{315}</span>
the mystic art. In the days when magic literature was sparse,
Prof. Fields obtained large sums of money from wealthy amateurs
for the secrets of tricks. Alas, the golden age of wizardry
has passed. Magic is an “open secret.” The Professor’s occupation
is gone.</p>

<p>I come now to François de Villiers, the French illusionist,
who is an excellent performer. He is able to invest the simplest
parlor trick with a halo of interest, thanks to his wit and
bonhomie. He was born in the Island of Malta, where Cagliostro
went to work in the chemical laboratory of the Grand
Commander Pinto. De Villiers when but a callow youth ran
away from the parental home and joined a French circus which
happened to be touring the Island of Malta. He wandered all
over the continent of Europe with the knights of the sawdust
circle, playing many parts, acrobat, clown and conjurer. Finally
he took up magic as a profession.</p>

<p>De Villiers next drifted to India, where he became a subject
of the British crown. Being of an adventurous nature, he
joined a cavalry regiment and wore the khaki of the Queen.
When his term of enlistment had expired, he went to Spain
and fought valiantly under the banner of Don Carlos. Captured
by the government forces, he was tried as a rebel and
condemned to be shot, but his sentence was commuted to banishment,
thanks to the timely intervention of the British Ambassador,
to whom he had appealed for aid. De Villiers is now a
naturalized citizen of the United States and his home is in New
York City.</p>

<p>Ziska is a magician of ability and possessed of much originality.
Assisted by Mr. King, he does an act in which magic
is blended with comedy. It is entitled “The Magician and His
Valet.” The conjurer is very clever and the valet very clumsy,
but no exposés of the tricks are made; Mr. Ziska is too much
of an artist to permit that.</p>

<p>J. Warren Keane is a clever manipulator of cards and billiard
balls. He gives a pleasing act of magic.</p>

<p>Prof. Barney Ives is possessed of great originality. Some
of his inventions have become famous. In this respect he is a
rival to the
celebrated Henry Hardin. <span class="xxpn" id="p316">{316}</span></p>

<p>De Biere and Stillwell are conjurers who are fast rising into
prominence. Stillwell is a handkerchief manipulator.</p>

<p>Next in line we have Malini, Fred Hurd, Hal Merton and
Maro, all of them clever magicians. Hurd’s rabbit and duck
trick has to be seen to be appreciated. Maro is not only an
excellent illusionist, but a musician and a crayon artist. Merton,
a favorite in the lyceum field, was at one time the editor of
“Mahatma.” Malini’s forte is cards, and he devotes most of
his time to giving drawing-room and club entertainments. Of
late years he has made London his home. Among the clever
amateurs I have met may be mentioned Mr. Guy L. Baker, of
Buffalo, N. Y., and Mr. LeRoy McCafferty and Mr. John J.
Allen, of Washington, D. C. Mr. Baker is an excellent drawing-room
conjurer and the originator of a novel method of working
the rising card trick <i>à la</i> de Kolta, by means of a clockwork
apparatus in the body of a small table. Mr. McCafferty is good
at hanky-panky, particularly with billiard balls; and Mr. Allen,
an ardent student of the art of deception, bids fair to become
a good entertainer.</p>

<p>Ere I bring this chapter to a close I must not neglect to
pay a tribute to my old-time friend, Dr. Leonard Caughey, of
Baltimore, Md., the finest amateur conjurer, rope-tying and
cabinet medium I have ever met. A dentist by profession, he
devoted his leisure time to magic. He died some fifteen years
ago in Washington, D. C. His cousin, Mr. Charles M. Caughey,
also an amateur pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur, is at present United States
Consul to Palermo, Sicily, the birthplace of Cagliostro. From
Dr. Caughey I received my first scientific instruction in the art
of palming and mediumistic marvels. I owe him a debt of
gratitude. In my little book “Hours With the Ghosts” I have
described some of my adventures with this admirable amateur
necromancer, who has passed from the lesser to the Greater
Mysteries. Long before Professor Hoffmann had written his
great treatise on “Modern Magic,” Dr. Caughey was thoroughly
initiated into all branches of magic, something unusual in those
days, and was giving splendid entertainments for churches,
lyceums, etc. A fine mechanic, he made most of his apparatus,
some of it of a very elaborate character.
I imported Hoffmann’s <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span>
book from England and showed it to him. He was paralyzed
with astonishment at the revelations contained in the volume
and exclaimed, “The golden days of magic are over. The
<i>Götterdämmerung</i> (Twilight of the Gods) has come! The
world will be as full of magicians as the Jersey coast is of mosquitoes.
The palmy days of Herrmann, Houdin and Heller
are ended.” His prophecy has been more or less fulfilled. The
vail of Isis is lifted and the mysteries of magic laid open to all
who care to delve in its literature and inform themselves. Alas,
unscrupulous professionals have contributed to this state of
things by exposing tricks on the stage for the benefit of the
public at large. This is indeed killing outright the goose that
lays the golden eggs. Initiate the <i>hoi polloi</i> into the secrets of
the cult, and magic will soon be relegated to the parlor as an
after-dinner amusement, unless some absolutely original genius
like Robert-Houdin or de Kolta arises and recreates the art.
The Society of British Magicians, known as “The Magic Circle
of Great Britain,” expels a member who wilfully exposes any
magical trick or illusion on the stage. The Society of American
Magicians comes out strongly against the reprehensible practice
of stage exposés, but as yet has taken no steps to expel members
who offend against the law. But that will doubtless come in

<p class="pfirst">What is the meaning of this Egyptian Temple, transplanted
from the banks of the Nile to prosaic London? The smoke
and grime have attacked it and played sad havoc with its sandstone
walls, painted with many hieroglyphics. The fog envelops
it with a spectral embrace. No Sphinxes guard its portal. Alas,
its glories have departed! But stop a bit! There is a gentleman
in evening dress, with a tall hat pushed well back from his forehead,
sitting in a small box-like receptacle on one side of the
colossal entrance, his face framed in by a small window; and
another man, similarly attired, standing at an iron wicket leading
into the sanctum sanctorum. The temple, then, <i>is</i> guarded by
two up-to-date, flesh-and-blood Sphinxes in swallow-tail coats
and opera hats. Ah me, what a travesty on the human-headed
monsters of the land of Mizraim. See the long line of worshipers
waiting to obtain admission to the Mysteries. Has
the cult of Isis and Osiris been revived? The devotees deposit
coins with Sphinx No. 1 and receive from him yellow tickets
in exchange, the presentation of which to Sphinx No. 2 permits
their entrance into the temple.</p>

<p>What does it all mean?</p>

<p>Dear reader, this is Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London, and

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span></div>

<p>But let us rehearse its history.</p>

<p>The Sphinx illusion, which has formed the basis of nearly
all tricks performed by the aid of looking-glasses, was invented
by Thomas Tobin, of the Polytechnic Institution, London.
Colonel Stodare, the conjurer, had the honor of first introducing
it to the world. The “London Times” (October 19, 1865)
describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Most intricate is the problem proposed by Colonel Stodare, when, in addition
to his admirable feats of ventriloquism and legerdemain, he presents
to his patrons a novel illusion called the ‘Sphinx.’ Placing upon an uncovered
table a chest similar in size to the cases commonly occupied by
stuffed dogs or foxes, he removes the side facing the spectators, and reveals
a head attired after the fashion of an Egyptian Sphinx. To avoid the suspicion
of ventriloquism, he retires to a distance from the figure, supposed
to be too great for the practice of that art, taking his position on the
border-line
of the stalls and the area, while the chest is on the stage. Thus stationed,
he calls upon the Sphinx to open its eyes, which it does—to smile, which it
does also, though the habitual expression of its countenance is most melancholy,
and to make a speech, which it does also, this being the miraculous
part of the exhibition. Not only with perspicuity, but with something like
eloquence, does it utter some twenty lines of verse; and while its countenance
is animated and expressive, the movement of the lips, in which there is
nothing mechanical, exactly corresponds to the sounds articulated.</p>

<p>“This certainly is one of the most extraordinary illusions ever presented
to the public. That the speech is spoken by a human voice there
is no doubt, but how is a head to be contrived which, being detached from
anything like a body, confined in a case, which it completely fills, and placed
on a bare-legged table, will accompany a speech, that apparently proceeds
from its lips, with a strictly appropriate movement of the mouth, and a
play of the countenance that is the reverse of mechanical? Eels, as we all
know, can wriggle about after they have been chopped into half a dozen
pieces; but a head that, like that of the Physician Douban, in the Arabian
tales, pursues its eloquence after it has been severed from the body, scarcely
comes within the reach of possibilities; unless, indeed, the old-fashioned
assertion that ‘King Charles walked and talked half an hour after his head
was cut off,’ is to be received, not as an illustration of defective punctuation,
but as a positive historical statement.</p>

<p>“Davus might have solved the ‘Anthropoglossus,’ but Colonel Stodare
presents us with a Sphinx that is really worthy of an Oedipus.”</p></blockquote>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">II.</h3>

<p>Mr. Alfred Thompson, the well known theatrical manager,
attended one of Stodare’s performances at the Egyptian Hall,
and was lucky enough to penetrate the secret of
the Sphinx. In <span class="xxpn" id="p321">{321}</span>
an article contributed to the <i>New York Journal</i>, some twenty
years ago, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I happened to rise in my seat. In a moment the whole illusion was
swept away, and all because of the lack of a silk handkerchief. As I stood
up my eye caught, hovering between two of the table legs, the marks of two
fingers, such marks as may often be seen on a mirror when the light falls at a
certain angle upon it.</p>

<div class="dctr03"><img src="images/i321.jpg"
width="456" height="631" alt="" /><div class="dcaption">
<span class="smcap">C<b>OLONEL</b></span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>TODARE.</b></span></div></div>

<p>“Those two finger marks, though close to the carpet, gave me the key
to the riddle of the Sphinx. In my mental photograph I saw the confederate
kneeling behind the table, his head passing through superposed apertures,
one in the top of the table, the other in the bottom of the box. The figure
was concealed from view by two mirrors of pure silver-plated glass, set at
such an angle as to reflect either side of the room (on the stage) in such
a way that what to the eye was evidently the back of the same room seen
beneath and beyond the table, was really only a reproduction of those sides
visible in the mirrors between the legs of the table. <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span></p>

<p>“This Sphinx was the sensation of London for weeks following, and
having occasion to go to Paris a few days later, I offered the secret to
Robert-Houdin’s successor, Hamilton, who, however, refused my terms until
he knew the trick. This delay of his was much regretted by him, for some
other speculator produced the secret some three months later and made a
colossal sensation in Paris with his ‘Decapite Parlant.’</p>

<p>“In the same year I introduced the illusion for the first time on the
stage in the celebrated spectacle of ‘Babil and Bijou’ at Covent Garden
Theatre. In the ballet of ‘The Seasons’ Mlle. Henriette Dor, one of the
most poetical dancers ever seen, appeared as the White Rose, and I designed
a large rose bud on its stalk, which, coming up through the bed of summer
flowers, blossomed wide until from its open petals the beautiful Dor rose
up, apparently materializing as she issued from the calix on the stalk. The
ballet girls were so arranged in groups around three sides (not in front)
as to aid the deception by their adjusted reflections in the mirrors.</p>

<p>“Practically it was the same trick—two mirrors at a right angle and a
trap door. This curious trick was never improved on. It was added to
and altered at the Polytechnic, where, among other adaptations of the same
principle, was shown an animated tableau of Sir Joshua Reynolds’ famous
cherubs. Three cherubs’ heads appeared in a moonlit sky, floating, and
sang in sweet child voices the verses of an anthem.</p>

<p>“Curiously enough I met the original Sphinx not three years ago in
the person of a business manager who had been Stodare’s agent, and only
three months back one of those very cherubs in Mr. Fred Solomon, the
comedian, who was then a chorister at the Chapel Royal, and who was
threatened with all sorts of tortures if he let the cat or the cherub out of
the bag.”</p></blockquote>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>One of the best explanations of the Sphinx is given by Professor
Hoffmann in his work on magic. I quote as follows from
him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“For the benefit of those who have never seen this illusion presented
upon the stage, we will describe its effect a little more minutely. The Sphinx
is always made a separate portion of the entertainment, as it is necessary to
lower the curtain for a few moments before and after its appearance, in
order to arrange and remove the necessary preparations. The curtain rises,
and reveals a round or oval table, supported upon three slender legs, and
utterly devoid of drapery. This stands in a curtained recess of ten or twelve
feet square, open on the side towards the audience. The performer comes
forward bearing a cloth covered box, fifteen to twenty inches square, and
places it upon the table already mentioned. He then unlocks the box, the
front of which drops down, so as to give a perfect view of the interior, in
which is seen a head of Egyptian fashion, and colored in perfect imitation
of life. The performer now retires to a position in the very midst of the
audience, and raising his wand, says in a tone of command, ‘Sphinx, awake!’
The Sphinx slowly opens its eyes, looking first to the front
with a strong <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
gaze; then, as if gradually gaining consciousness, to the one side and the
other, the head moving slightly with the eyes. Questions are put by the
performer to the head, and are answered by it, the play of the mouth and
features being in perfect harmony with the sounds uttered. Finally, in answer
to a query of the operator, the Sphinx declaims a neatly turned oracle
in verse. This concludes the exhibition, and the performer closes the box.
Should the audience call for an encore, the performer addresses them to the
following or some similar effect:</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that the Sphinx has afforded you
satisfaction, and I should be only too pleased to be able to indulge the desire
which you kindly testify of seeing it again. Unfortunately, this is not possible.
The charm by which I am enabled, as you have seen, to revivify for
a space the ashes of an ancient Egyptian, who lived and died some centuries
ago, lasts but for fifteen minutes. That time has now expired, and the head
which has astonished you with its mysterious eloquence has again returned
to its original dust.’ As he speaks the last words, he again opens the box,
and the head is found to have disappeared, leaving in its place a handful
of ashes.</p>

 <span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span> 2.</span>
</div></div>

<p>“This singular illusion depends upon the well-known principle, common
to optics as to mechanics, that the ‘angle of reflection is equal to the angle
of incidence.’ Thus, if a person standing at the point <i>a</i>, in Fig. 1, look into
a mirror placed in the position indicated by the line <i>b&#xa0;c</i>, he will see reflected,
not himself, but whatever object may be placed at the point <i>d</i>. By an ingenious
application of this principle a looking-glass may be used to conceal
a given object behind it, while at the same time an image reflected in the
glass may be made to represent what would be presumably seen if no glass
were there, and thus prevent the presence of the mirror from being suspected.
This is the secret of the Sphinx. The table, as already mentioned, has
three legs, one in front, and one at each side. Between these legs the spectator
sees apparently the curtains at the back of the recess, but really a reflection
of the curtains at the sides. The space between the middle leg and
that on either side is occupied by pieces of looking-glass (see Fig. 2, which
represents a ground plan of the arrangements), extending from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, and
<i>a</i> to <i>c</i>. The glass extends quite down to the floor, which is covered with
cloth of the same material and color as the
surrounding curtains. The <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span>
spectators, therefore, looking towards the table, see above it the curtains at the
back, and below it the reflection of the curtains at the sides; which, however,
if the relative angles are properly arranged, appears to be simply the
continuation or lower portion of the curtains at the back. The illusion is
perfect, and the spectator, from the position assigned to him, cannot possibly
discover, by the evidence of his senses, that he is looking at any other than
an ordinary bare-legged table, with the background visible in the usual way.</p>

<p>“The rest is a very simple matter. The person who is to represent
the Sphinx is beforehand placed, duly attired, underneath the table. There
is a trap in the table through which he can pass his head at the proper
moment. This trap is a round piece of wood, covered to match the surface
of the table, and working on a hinge on the side nearest to the audience. It
has no spring, but is kept closed by means of a button on the opposite side,
and when released hangs down perpendicularly. It must be large enough to
allow the passage of the somewhat elaborate headpiece of the Sphinx, and
would therefore leave an open space visible round the neck. This difficulty
is met by the expedient of having a wooden collar, the upper surface of
which is a facsimile in size and pattern of the trap. This collar is fastened
round the neck of the representative of the Sphinx. When he lifts his head
up through the trap, the collar exactly fills the opening, and thus shows no
break in the surface of the table. The box is bottomless, and when brought
forward by the performer is empty. A little caution has to be observed in
placing it upon the table, for, if the performer were to approach the table
<i>from the side</i>, his legs would be reflected in the glass, and would thereby
betray the secret. He must therefore make his appearance from some quarter
<i>outside</i> of the curtained recess, and advance to a position well in front
of, and at some little distance from the table, when, by moving in a straight
line from the audience towards the middle leg <i>a</i>, he prevents this inconvenient
reflection. The placing the box upon the table, and the unlocking
it, allow time for the representative of the Sphinx to get his head into position
within it. This done, the box is opened, and the rest depends on the
dramatic talent of the performer and his assistant. The performance being
concluded, the box is again locked, and the head withdrawn, a handful of
ashes being introduced on the trap in its stead.</p>

<p>“The angle at which the two mirrors should be set cannot be determined
absolutely, but will vary according to the distance and position of the surrounding
drapery.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The above method is generally employed in working the
Sphinx illusion, but it differs in one respect from that used by
Colonel Stodare. In the Colonel’s presentation of the trick,
the box was not <i>bottomless</i>. It had a trap in it corresponding
with a similar trap in the top of the table. Stodare carried
the mystic chest to the “run down” after the lid was closed,
and then, by his ventriloquial power, caused a muffled voice to
issue from the receptacle, presumably that of the Sphinx. Thus
the spectators were led to believe that the head was
still in the <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span>
box, and that the table had nothing whatever to do with the
trick. On opening the chest great was the surprise of everyone
to behold the head completely vanished, the heap of ashes having
taken its place. This was a very clever bit of <i>mise en scène</i>, and
showed what an artist Stodare was.</p>

<p>And now for a word or two concerning the career of the
clever producer of the Sphinx. Colonel Stodare never smelt
powder nor directed the manœuvres of a regiment of red coats.
His title was self-assumed, to bedazzle the English public. He
never wielded any weapon save a wooden wand tipped with ivory.
But he did that to perfection. His real name was Alfred Inglis.
Little or nothing is known of his early life and education. His
first appearance was at the Egyptian Hall, London, on Easter
Monday, April 17, 1865, when he introduced, for the first time
in England, those celebrated illusions of Hindostan, the “Mango
Tree” and the “Indian Basket.” It was on the occasion of his
two-hundredth consecutive representation at the aforesaid hall
that Stodare introduced the “Sphinx” trick, which at once attracted
crowds. On Tuesday evening, November 21, 1865, he
had the honor to appear before Queen Victoria, at Windsor
Castle, on the occasion of the birthday of H. R. H. the Princess
Royal, afterwards the Empress Frederick of Germany. Stodare
died of consumption in 1866. He wrote two small treatises on
magic: <i>The Art of Magic</i> (1865) and <i>Stodare’s Fly-notes</i>
(1866).</p>

<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>The inventor of the Sphinx, Mr. Tobin, sold the secret to
M. Talrich, of Paris, the proprietor of a wax-works exhibition
on the Boulevard de la Madeline. Talrich called his collection of
figures the Musée Français. Impressed with the success of
Madame Tussaud’s “Chamber of Horrors,” in connection with
her wax-works exhibition in London, Talrich transformed the
“Talking Head” into the “Decapitated Speaker.” His presentation
of the illusion was calculated to strike terror in the mind of
the observer. Underneath his museum was a damp and mouldy
cellar, which he fitted up for the exhibition. The visitor was
conducted down a stairway, dimly lighted by a
couple of antique <span class="xxpn" id="p326">{326}</span>
lamps suspended from the vaulted roof. When he reached the
bottom he was suddenly confronted with a group of wax figures
representing a scene under the Inquisition. Every detail of a
torture chamber was given, such as is described by Victor Hugo
in his <i>Notre Dame de Paris</i>. The cowled emissaries of the Holy
Office were depicted in the act of putting a wretched victim to
the torture. The light from a flambeau, held by one of the
figures, illumined the ghastly scene. In this uncertain light everything
was horribly majestic. Pushing onward and turning to the
right, “the spectator passed through a dimly-lighted corridor,
and found himself in front of a balustrade, breast-high, which
extended across the entrance of a narrow recess. In the middle
of this gloomy cellar, the floor of which was carpeted with musty
straw, was seen a table, on which rested a human head, leaning
slightly to one side and apparently asleep. On being addressed
by the exhibitor the head raised itself, opened its eyes, and
related its own history, including the details of its decapitation,
after which it replied, in various languages, to questions put by
those present.”</p>

<p>One day a party of young students, out for a lark, began
shooting bread pellets at the head, in order to test whether it
had entirely lost all sensation. The Decapitated One, in his
wrath, abused them soundly, in language that savored more of
modern Paris than the days of the Inquisition. This affair got
noised abroad, and gay young boulevardiers made up regular
parties to go and shoot pellets at the head; this amusement they
called “pop-gun practice.” Some of these pellets, not so well
“bred” (pardon the pun) as others, struck certain portions of
the table which were apparently open, but from which they rebounded,
clearly indicating that the supposed vacant space was
really a sheet of looking-glass. M. Talrich then put a close-meshed
wire grating between the spectators and their victim, but
alas! the secret of the Inquisition was disclosed, and the palmy
days of the Musée Francais were over. Says Houdin: “The
cause of M. Talrich’s failure was the same that brought disaster
to the Brothers Davenport. Too great confidence in the Parisian
public led both parties to offer what, after all, were but ingenious
conjuring tricks as supernatural phenomena.” <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span></p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">V.</h3>

<p>A few years ago, the eminent English novelist, H. Rider-Haggard,
evolved from his elastic imag­i­na­tion a weird and
wonderful romance of Darkest Africa, called “She, who must
be obeyed.” It was redolent of magic and mystery. The beautiful
sorceress, “She,” a damsel of Greek descent, had lived for
centuries in the heart of Africa, ruling over generations of black
subjects with an iron despotism, and subduing them by her
necromantic power. She was worshiped as a goddess. Her
immortality upon earth was due to the rejuvenating effects of
the mystic fire of Kor, into which she plunged and renewed her
youth at certain periods. Balling in love with a young English
explorer, who had succeeded in penetrating into her realm, the
Rosicrucian spell was broken, and the beautiful “She” shriveled
up and expired in agony while attempting to bathe in the flames
of Kor. The scene, as depicted by the novelist, is very awe-inspiring.
The book had a great vogue in its day, and was
dramatized with fine effect.</p>

<span class="smcap">“S<b>HE</b>.”</span>
<span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span> 2.</span></div></div>

<p>“Have you seen ‘She’?” was the apparently ungrammatical
question asked by theatre-goers.</p>

<p>Finally, the conjurer, always ready to seize upon the fads
and fancies of the day to make capital out of them, took the
chief <i>motif</i> of Rider-Haggard’s romance, and built
upon it one <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
of the very best illusions in the domain of magic, called “She.” I
have understood that the inventor of “She” was the Chevalier
Thorne. In this act, a young lady, garbed as the witch of
the Dark Continent, was cremated in full view of the audience.
It was the Sphinx trick over again, but in a more ingenious
shape. The lady mounted a bare-legged table, whereupon an
asbestos canopy was lowered over her, so that she was completely
concealed from the audience. Suddenly flames and
smoke poured forth from beneath the canopy. The shrieks of
the victim were heard. When the cover was raised, nothing was
to be seen except a blackened skull and some charred bones—the
lady was presumably cremated. In another version of the
trick, the skull and bones were dispensed with, and the lady
reappeared in a private box or came running down the center
aisle of the theatre, after the canopy was lifted.</p>

<p>Now for an explanation of the illusion.</p>

<p>The spectators saw an innocent-looking table with four legs,
and beneath it, supported by a central rod, four supports holding
lighted candles, very much on the order of a chandelier. This latter
effect seemed to preclude the idea of mirrors being used. “But
things are seldom what they seem,” in magic at least. In reality
the table had but <i>two</i> legs, and there were but <i>two</i> candles burning,
the remaining legs and tapers being reflections. How was
the deception accomplished? In the following manner: Converging
at the central standard (Fig. 1) were two plane mirrors,
fixed at an angle of ninety degrees with each other and forty-five
degrees with the side panels of the screen which boxed in
the table from the rest of the stage. These mirrors reflected
the side panels, which were of the same color as the panel at
the back, and made the spectators believe that they saw underneath
the table the rear of the screen. They also reflected the
two legs of the table and the two supports with their lighted
candles. The triangular wooden box, upon the sides of which
the mirrors were fastened, extended to the back panel of the
screen. It was covered with cloth of the same color as that
of the screen. This box was on a level with the top of the table.</p>

<p>The lady got away through a trap, after having placed the
skull and bones in position and ignited a lot of red
fire (Fig 2). <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span></p>

<p>Another illusion in which the looking-glass plays a part is
that of the Decapitated Princess. Instead of a table, a chair
is used. The head stands upright upon two swords, which rest
on the arms of the chair. A mirror, placed at an angle of forty-five
degrees, reaching from the front part of the arms to the back
edge of the seat, reflects the bottom of the chair, thereby inducing
the spectators to believe that they see the back of the chair;
<i>ergo</i>, the seat is empty. Of course, this seat is covered with
like material as that of the back of the elaborately carved throne
chair. The glass conceals the trap at the back, through which
the lady sticks her head and part of her body. She wears about
her neck a lace collar, so arranged as to rest nicely on the two
Swords.</p>

<p>I first saw this interesting illusion exhibited in a <i>café
chantant</i> in Paris. The fat, thick-necked, little Frenchman, who
presented the trick to the audience, reminded me of one of those
human-headed bulls carved upon the walls of Assyrian palaces
and temples. His hair and beard were oiled and curled. He
bellowed out the marvels of his decapitated Princess, and flirted
the skirts of his long Prince Albert coat like an animal lashing
flies off its flanks with its tail. According to this Chevalier
d’Ananias, the Princess lost her charming little powdered head
during the reign of Robespierre I; it “sneezed into the basket”
of the guillotine one fine morning while the knitting women
sat around the scaffold and plied their needles and tongues.
“Down with the Aristocrats!” Thanks to an eminent surgeon,
who begged the head from the executioner, it was restored to
life by hypnotic power. The surgeon handed it down to his
descendants. Finally it came into possession of the showman,
by what means the gentleman did not relate.</p>

<p>A few days after the above exhibition, I saw the poor little
Princess eating cabbage soup in a second-class <i>cabaret</i>. Her
manager was with her. Her head was on her body
at the time.</p></div><!--section-->

foot of a throne, to become captain of the Grand Monarque’s
bodyguard, and eventually a marshal of France.</p>

<p>In the world of magic we have a similar character, not a
mere figment, however, of the novelist’s imag­i­na­tion, but a
living, breathing personality. I refer to Félicien Trewey, the
eminent French fantaisiste, whose life reads like a romance.
M. Trewey possesses all of the qualities of heart and mind of
Dumas’ hero—audacity, versatility, tireless energy in the pursuit
of his profession, bonhomie, and what not. Had he lived in the
seventeenth century, he doubtless would have been a soldier of
fortune like D’Artagnan, fought duels, made love to duchesses,
and outwitted a cardinal, but having been born in an age of
steam and electricity, and fully realizing the fact that science
has reduced the art of war to mere mechanics, he sought out a
career that promised the most romance and adventure, and
became a mousquetaire of magic, wielding the
wand instead of <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
the sword. It is a long, long way from the half-starved mountebank
of a wandering caravan to an <i>Officier d’Académie</i> and
landed proprietor living at ease in one’s old age. But Trewey
has accomplished all this.</p>

<p>My interest was at once aroused. Here was no ordinary
artist, but a man of versatility. I bought a ticket, and was soon
seated in the theatre. After the usual infliction of skirt-dancers,
acrobats and eccentric singers with raspy voices, the curtain rose
on M. Trewey’s act. I sighed with relief. Ah, here was an
oasis in the vast Sahara of vaudeville
claptrap and mediocrity. <span class="xxpn" id="p333">{333}</span>
I was not disappointed. The stage was elegantly set with gilt tables.
The scene was boxed in with rich silk curtains <i>à la</i> Pinetti.
A burst of applause (not confined to the <i>claque</i> either), and the
great Trewey appeared. A long black cloak enveloped him.</p>

<p>Throwing this off, he appeared in full court costume—a gentleman
of the reign of Louis XVI. I felt like asking him, “When
did you see last the Chevalier Pinetti?” After a very superior
exhibition of juggling and sleight of hand with
cards and coins, <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span>
he passed on to ombromanie, or hand-made shadows, among
them being portraits of Thiers, Gladstone, Czar Alexander III,
Emile Zola, Gambetta, Bismarck, Crispi and Lord Salisbury.
The art of casting silhouettes of animals, such as the dog, the
cat, and the rabbit, upon an illuminated wall is very ancient.
The Italian painter, Campi, was one of the first to add new
types to the collection of figures. Trewey raised the art to the
dignity of a stage performance, and endowed it with movement
and life. I shall quote as follows from an article on Trewey,
contributed by me to the “Cosmopolitan Magazine” some years
ago:</p>

<p>“He stands behind a screen, which is brilliantly illuminated
by an oxyhydrogen light, and with his hands projects the silhouettes—pictures
of soldiers, peasants, abbés, etc., to say nothing
of animals. To form the headgear of his men and women,
such as the grotesque bonnets of Norman bonnes, the képis
of the little piou-pious, and the mortar-boards of the English
scholastics, he has recourse to small pieces of cardboard cut to
resemble the respective cranial coverings. Trewey is not content
with the ‘cold profiles,’ as he calls them,
of living creatures,
<span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
but endows his shadows with animation. His old peasants, for
example, smoke, imbibe liquor from large jugs, inhale snuff,
roll their eyes, open their mouths, gesticulate; his animals are
exceedingly mobile. Besides this, he makes his characters enact
charming little pantomimic scenes. One he calls the ‘serenade.’
A piece of cardboard, fashioned to represent the side of a house,
constitutes the scenery. A gendarme (supposed
to be violently <span class="xxpn" id="p337">{337}</span>
in love with the servant girl) knocks at the door of the mansion,
whereupon his fair <i>inamorata</i> appears at the upstairs window.
After an exchange of compliments, she withdraws from the
window and reappears at the door. She gives to her lover a
drink from a suspicious bottle, and he, after wiping his beard,
kisses her and retires. Then comes the strolling musician, playing
a lugubrious melody on the clarinet. The owner of the
house rushes to the bedroom window and motions the player
away, but the musician derisively strikes up a lively tune. The
irate proprietor now makes his appearance armed with a long
broom, with which he thrashes the clarinettist. The musician
still persisting, paterfamilias next produces the water jug, and
from the upstairs window pours the contents upon the head of
the luckless serenader, who quickly makes his exit.</p>

<p>“The little accessories used in this act, such as the helmet for
the policeman, the broom, bottle, etc., are cut from pasteboard
and, where necessary, attached to the fingers of the performer
by means of india-rubber rings. The water jug, however, is an
actual little vessel, which is filled with sand. When this is poured
out it simulates a flow of water in the most natural manner.</p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘The pulpit orator’ is a clever silhouette. About the left
arm of the performer is tied a small box, which represents the
pulpit; the bent fingers make a canopy. Between
the fingers of <span class="xxpn" id="p338">{338}</span>
the right hand is held a bit of pasteboard, cut in the shape of a
mortar-board cap. The paraphernalia is very simple. You see
the learned divine ascend the pulpit, bend forward in prayer,
then begin to exhort an imaginary congregation. He thumps
the pulpit rail vehemently, twists himself into all sorts of grotesque
positions, and wipes his perspiring brow. After having
blessed the people, he descends from his elevated perch.”</p>

<p>I learned from him many interesting things about shadowgraphy
and sleight of hand generally. To excel in the art of
ombromanie requires long practice. The fingers have to be
exercised continuously in certain peculiar movements, such as
are depicted in the accompanying illustration. Dexterity is
largely dependent upon the formation of the hand, one of the
particular characteristics of skillfulness being “the faculty of
reversing the metacarpal phalanges of the fingers, so that when
the hand is extended it is convex.” Trewey possesses this faculty.
Another peculiarity of his hands is the formation of the
fingers: they differ very much in length. The middle finger
exceeds the ring finger by nearly an inch.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">III.</h3>

<p>I met Trewey some weeks later, in London, at the Empire
Theatre, and we struck up a great friendship which has lasted
to this day. The story of his life is full of interest, and is
a typical example of the folly of setting anyone to a vocation for
which he has no particular taste. Intended at first for the priesthood
by his parents, and subsequently for a mechanical trade,
Trewey followed his own inclinations—conjuring and juggling.
I will quote again from my paper in the “Cosmopolitan Magazine”:</p>

<p>“Like most artists who have risen to eminence on the
French stage, Trewey has known hardships and bitter poverty.
His youth was a struggle against adverse conditions. But he
had in him, in its truest sense, the soul of old Gaul—that joyous
insouciance, that sardonic humor, which laughs at fortune and
snaps its finger at the world. Natural vivacity will often keep
a Frenchman alive, though his body is clothed in
rags and his <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span>
stomach is empty. Trewey was born at Angoulême, France,
during the Revolution of 1848. His father was an engineer in
a paper mill. Trewey <i>pére</i> was ambitious for his son to enter
the Church, so he sent him to the Seminary of the Holy Trinity
at Marseilles to study for the priesthood. But fate had willed
otherwise. When quite a young boy, Trewey had been taken
to see a circus at Marseilles. Among the mountebanks was a
conjurer, who gave a very interesting exhibition. The feats of
magic of this strolling Merlin so fascinated the little Trewey
that he forthwith secretly vowed to become a professional pre­sti­di­gi­ta­teur
as soon as he grew up. The studies pursued at the
Jesuit college did not cure the boy of his love for the stage.
He divided his time between Latin verbs and juggling, mathematics
and the art of palmistry. Soon he was able to give
little exhibitions, private, of course, for the amusement of his
comrades. The good fathers must have thought him a very
eccentric youth, for he was continually trying to balance his
slate on the tip of his nose. Many a well-deserved cat-o’-nine-tails
he got for his improvised feats of equilibration. Lying
awake at night in the silent dormitory, he invented tricks, then
fell asleep to dream of the wild delights of the mountebank’s
life—wandering like a gipsy over the country in a caravan, and
performing at the little French villages and towns before crowds
of rustics. He pictured himself dressed in gorgeous raiment,
exhibiting magic tricks for the amusement of gaping yokels—pulling
rabbits from hats, turning omelets into doves, and producing
bowls of goldfish from shawls. The boom, boom, of the
bass drum, calling the spectators together, resounded in his ears.
The boy had in him the spirit of adventure; the blood of some
old strolling player of an ancestor ran in his veins. He longed
to escape from under the watchful domination of the ‘black
robes,’ as he designated the good priests of the seminary. Three
years passed. One day, during the Christmas holidays, Trewey
refused to return to his studies, so his father placed him in the
engine room of the paper mill to learn machinery. Cog wheels
and oil cans possessed no more fascination for him than Latin
and Greek. One fine summer day he ran away from home in
company
with an acrobat. <span class="xxpn" id="p340">{340}</span></p>

<p>“Trewey, at this period of his career, was not over fifteen
years of age, and had but little experience of men and manners.
The quiet cloisters of a Jesuit seminary are not conducive to
knowledge of the world. Life now became hard for Trewey
and his companion, the youthful tumbler. They exhibited in
market places, cafés, and in inn yards. The life they led was
next door to starvation. Soon Trewey left the acrobat and
obtained an engagement at one of the small music halls of
Marseilles. The munificent sum of six francs per week (one
dollar and twenty cents) was the salary he received for his services.
In addition to his juggling exhibition, given several times
a day, he was obliged to appear in a pantomime performance
at night. In this troupe was the famous Plessis, who eventually
became one of the foremost comedians of France, rivaling even
the great Coquelin.</p>

<p>“In those days it was the custom for people to throw money
on the stage to favorite performers. Applauding with the hands
being monopolized by a paid claque, there was no better way for
enthusiastic spectators, in French places of amusement, to show
their appreciation of the talents of an artist, than by showering
upon him gold, silver or copper coins. The vaudeville artists
did not consider it beneath their dignity to stoop and gather up
these substantial evidences of public favor.</p>

<p>“Said Trewey to me: ‘I saved these coins until I was able
to purchase two fine costumes. Then I secured an engagement
at the Alcazar at Marseilles.’</p>

<p>“Other engagements followed this, and Trewey became the
most popular performer in the south of France. The desire for
a roving life led him to become the proprietor of a traveling
pantomime and vaudeville company. His versatility was shown
here. He juggled, conjured, played Pierrot in the pantomime,
danced in the clodoche, and managed the finances of the troupe.
After two years of this life, he got an engagement at Bordeaux.
It was here that he invented his ombromanie, and straightway
became famous. From Bordeaux he migrated to Paris. His
success was instantaneous.”</p>

<p>The journalists rallied to his aid. He became the lion of
the hour. <i>L’Illustration</i> named his art Treweyism. His reputation
was established. <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span></p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">IV.</h3>

<p>Trewey is a mimic <i>par excellence</i>. He is past master in the
art of pantomime and facial expression. One of his particular
acts, which has given rise to numerous imitations, is entitled,
“Tabarin, or Twenty-five Heads Under One Chapeau.” Thanks
to a piece of black felt cloth, circular in shape, with a hole cut
in the center, Trewey is able to manufacture in a few minutes
all the varieties of headgear required for the Tabarin. For
example: Napoleon—A couple of twists of the cloth, and lo!
you have a representation of <i>le chapeau de Marengo</i>, the little
cocked hat which Napoleon made famous, and about which so
many legends cluster. With this hastily improvised hat on his
head, Trewey assumes the Napoleonic attitude—one hand thrust
into his vest, the other behind his back. His physiognomy is
that of the great Emperor, as depicted by the painters of the
Imperial régime. The likeness is perfect. And so with fat
French priests, soldiers, bonnes, landladies, artists, diplomats,
etc. It is a portrait gallery of French types; Gavarni lives for
us again. And just here, let me digress a moment to explain
the origin of the curious word <i>Tabarin</i>, which, as all lovers of
French comedy know, has passed into the repertory of the
national theatre. In the seventeenth century, that bridge of
memories, the old Pont Neuf of Paris, was the rendezvous of
quacksalvers and mountebanks. Booths for the sale of various
articles lined the sides of the bridge. People flocked there to
see the sights, to laugh, chat, make love and enjoy life as only
Parisians can. Students and grisettes of the <i>Quartier Latin</i>
elbowed ladies and gentlemen of the court. Bourgeois families
came to study the flippant manners of their superiors. Poodle
clippers plied their trade; jugglers amused the <i>quid nuncs</i> with
feats of dexterity; traveling dentists pulled teeth and sold balsams;
clowns tumbled, and last, but not least, pickpockets lifted
purses and silk handkerchiefs with impunity. Says Augustus
J. C. Hare (<i>Walks in Paris</i>): “So central an artery is the Pont
Neuf, that it used to be a saying with the Parisian police, that
if, after watching three days, they did not see a man cross the
bridge, he must have left Paris.” Any popular witticism in
verse was long known as <i>un Pont-Neuf</i>. One
of the principal <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
vendors of quack nostrums of the Pont Neuf was Montdor. He
was aided by a buffoon named Tabarin, who made facetious
replies to questions asked by his master, accompanied with
laughable grimaces and grotesque gestures. The modern ringmaster
and clown of the circus have similar scenes together,
minus the selling of medicines. Tabarin was celebrated for his
wit. Some of his <i>bon mots</i> have descended to our time. He
performed the feat of making some ten different hats out of the
brim of a felt hat, giving appropriate facial portraits beneath
each, and using wigs and beards to enhance the effect. Such, in
brief, is the story of the famous Merry Andrew whose name has
become a by-word in France for buffoonery and broad humor.
The biographies of such men would make interesting reading
for the student of history. But Dame Clio has eyes only for
tremendous battles, diplomatic intrigues, the doings of royalty
and great folk. The little world of everyday life, that busy
ant hill where the human comedy is so ardently played, is beneath
her notice. The life and adventures of quacksalvers, minor
poets, wandering jugglers, faugh!—that is asking too much of
the Muse of History. Says Guizot: “History has no room for
all those who throng about her gates without succeeding in
getting in and leaving traces of their stay.”</p>

<p>But occasionally a man or woman rises from the dregs of
the people and compels recognition; and, sad to relate, nine times
out of ten, through the commission of crimes. Have we not
Cagliostro and Madame de la Motte, thorough-paced scoundrels
and charlatans, but, nevertheless, very delightful folk, who have
added a tinge of romance to history? I for one, with Thackeray,
confess a weakness for the tittle-tattle of court gossip and
backstairs diplomacy. Behind the scenes with Louis XV and
XVI, Frederick the Great and Catherine II is far more entertaining
than the battles of the period. Casanova gives one a
better picture of eighteenth century morals and manners than
any of the great historians of the time. History is the dry bones
of an epoch; the memoir writers are the Ezekiels who behold
the bones clothed with flesh and thrilling with life-blood.</p>

<p>Wandering one morning across the old Pont Neuf, all these
thoughts came to my mind. Once again, as in the
days of long
<span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
ago, I saw, in my imag­i­na­tion, the bridge crowded with people.
There came to me the faint rustling of silk skirts, the clatter of
high-heeled shoes upon the paving stones. Boom! boom! goes
the drum. I hear the strident voice of Montdor shouting out his
wares, and the unctuous notes of the comical Tabarin uttering a
<i>bon mot</i>.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3 class="h3mid">V.</h3>

<p>Trewey is the inventor of many clever card sleights and
passes; for example, a color change executed by taking cards
from the back of the pack with the fork of the thumb and forefinger
and placing them on the front. The origin of this clever
sleight is not generally known. I have seen him throw cards
from the stage of the Alhambra Theatre, London, to the topmost
gallery. This is a tremendous feat, as the Alhambra is one of
the largest theatres in the world. He possesses the peculiar
talent of writing in reverse, necessitating the use of a mirror
in order to read it. The artistic sentiment was born in him.
It seems to be a family characteristic. Rosa Bordas, the celebrated
French <i>chanteuse patriotique</i>, is his cousin-german. A
writer in <i>L’Echo des Jeunes</i> thus apostrophises him in verse:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Dans
 le monde artistique ou son étoile brille,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Trewey ne peut que resortir,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Vraiment, cela tient de famille,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Vu que bon sang ne peut mentir.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The most exclusive and aristocratic salons of Paris and
Vienna have engaged his services for private séances. In Spain,
Belgium, Austria, Russia and England he was the sensation of
the day. At the present time he is living in retirement at Asnières,
near Paris, where he has purchased a charming home
known as the Villa Traversière <i>au clair de la lune</i>. During
the Exposition of 1900 he was the manager of the Theatre
Phono-Cinéma. Trewey was a great friend of the French inventor,
Lumière, and was the first to introduce the cinematographe
to the public of London and Paris. At his villa he
spends his time inventing and improving devices to be used in
moving-picture apparatus, corresponding with his friends, meditating
upon the works of his favorite
authors, Confucius and
<span class="xxpn" id="p346">{346}</span>
Epictetus, and writing songs, farces and dramatic articles. In
the year 1903 he was made an <i>Officier d’Académie</i> by the French
Government. He married Miss Ixa, of Trocadero fame. Among
his pupils may be mentioned the lady conjurer, Mlle. Patrice.</p>

<p>Trewey relates many interesting anecdotes of contemporary
French magicians whom he has met on his travels. He is literally
a man without envy. His admiration for Buatier de Kolta
was unbounded. They were close friends.</p>

<p>He once toured the Continent with the Hungarian conjurer,
Velle, who was the first to give exhibitions within a marked
circle, where the audience could gather on all sides. Velle impersonated
Mephisto to perfection. Trewey and August Lassaigne
were once partners. Lassaigne was born in Toulouse,
in 1819. Besides being a magician he was an æronaut, having
made 347 ascensions. He died in Montpellier in the year 1887.</p>

<p>When Trewey first toured the United States, under the management
of Alexander Herrmann, he was very much annoyed
by impostors, who advertised themselves as <i>Drewey</i>, but their
performances were only weak imitations of the original—the
merest shadows of a shade. In the wake of the whale follow
little fishes—“pikers”—who grab at the crumbs dropped by the
monarch of the sea, being too lazy or indifferent to find hunting
seas of their own.</p>

<p>“Many amateurs are more skillful than professionals,” said
Trewey to me. “I have in mind my friend Alexandre Asso,
who was born in Paris in the year 1828. While a student, he
once happened to be present at a soirée where M. Comte was
giving an exhibition. He was so fascinated that he afterwards
took lessons in legerdemain from the professor. When he finished
his schooling, he entered the service of the Count de Nigra,
then Ambassador to Italy, and remained with him for forty
years, visiting London, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and other great
capitals. Asso often entertained the Count and his friends with
conjuring séances. In this way he amused society at nearly all
the Courts of Europe, besides giving many entertainments for
the benefit of the poor. In spite of his advanced age, he still
keeps in practice as a conjurer at his villa
at Asnières. He <span class="xxpn" id="p347">{347}</span>
retired from an active life in 1903. We see a great deal of each
other.</p>

<p>“Then we have M. Pitau, a wine merchant, who studied
legerdemain to amuse his friends and increase his custom. He
was a capital guest at the hotel table. People loved to be seated
near him, for he was not only skilful at hanky panky with
glasses, plates, napkins, knives, corks, coins, etc., but he was a
brilliant raconteur and a mimic. His most amusing trick was
the following: He would place his hat over his plate, which held
perhaps a chop and potatoes. Passing his hand under the hat
he would bring forth several five-franc pieces. Then he would
pass it a second time beneath the chapeau and bring out five or
six gold one-hundred-franc pieces. Now he would exclaim:
‘Ladies and gentlemen, I will give what is left on the plate for
ten centimes.’ Lifting the hat, a child’s sock or
an old shoe <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span>
would be seen, the chop and potatoes having vanished. This
feat was always greeted with shouts of laughter. Pitau often
gave entire performances for charitable purposes.”</p>

<p>Behind the scenes in an Egyptian temple would doubtless
have revealed many curious secrets of natural magic to the
uninitiated. Like all so-called sorcerers, the priests evidently
compiled works on the subject of their art for the benefit of
their successors. But not one of these has come down to us.
Hermes Trismegistus is said to have written two myriads of
books on the occult sciences. He was the Alexander Dumas of
the Egyptian pantheon.</p>

<p>Trewey, an apt descendant of the ancient magi of the land
of Mizraim, has compiled a ponderous folio of illusions and feats
of juggling and legerdemain; a great manuscript volume of
mysteries, the text of which is illustrated by pen-and-ink
sketches by himself. Over two thousand magical experiments
are described and explained in this tome of thaumaturgy, gathered
from all sources, many of them being his own inventions,
perhaps the majority of them. I know that this volume exists,
for I have seen it and glanced over it. I have urged Trewey to
publish the work. Perhaps he will some day, now that he has
the leisure for literary labors. He is at present at work on his
invention, the <i>Treweyorama</i>, which will be exhibited soon in
Paris.</p></div><!--section-->

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
